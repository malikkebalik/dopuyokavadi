For </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span style=font-weight:400>Jimbo Fisher</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, he just scored a massive amount of money to go away.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-354173 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1427048873.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-354173 class=wp-caption-text>Tom Pennington/Getty Images</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Texas A&M fired Fisher on November 12. He'll make the remaining </span><b>$76 million </b><span style=font-weight:400>on his deal, a record amount for a head coach buyout. It's more than twice what any other coach has gotten in a buyout agreement. And just as spectacularly, Fisher will make all of this money even if he ends up coaching another team, potentially earning money from two schools at once.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Fisher was fired the day after his Aggies defeated Mississippi State 51-10. The blowout victory wasn't enough to keep his job, however.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In six seasons with Texas A&M, Fisher compiled a 45-25 record. Yet the Aggies could never find consistent success on the field. The team finished 9-1 and won the Orange Bowl during the Covid-shortened 2020 season, which was the highlight of Fisher's tenure.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Texas A&M never won the SEC West or made the College Football Playoff under Fisher's watch. Aside from 2020, the program has lost at least four games each year and posted a 5-7 record in 2022. In fact, since that Orange Bowl season, Fisher's Aggies have gone a pedestrian 19-15 overall and 10-13 in the SEC.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>To put into perspective just how much money Fisher is making, </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span style=font-weight:400>consider this comparison</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>: Fisher will average $26,301 every single day for the next eight years to not coach for Texas A&M. His first coaching job, as an offensive coordinator at Samford, paid him $20,000 for the entire season.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Fisher signed a ten-year deal in 2021. That contract included $95 million in guaranteed money and was almost a panic signing. Texas A&M was worried Fisher would leave the university for LSU. The Tigers </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span style=font-weight:400>hired Brian Kelly instead</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Now, Fisher has the ability to go wherever he wants. However, after earning such a staggering amount of money, we wouldn't blame him if he took some time off.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue56pdGxtZGaEcw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
