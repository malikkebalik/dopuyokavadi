It was<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> reported by WTOC</a> that the coroner’s office said that Mallory drowned after suffering blunt-force trauma.</p><p>When help arrived at the scene of the accident, Paul, Morgan Doughty, and their friends Miley Altman, Connor Cook, and Anthony Cook were all sent to a local hospital for treatment. Blood was drawn from Paul at the hospital, and the results indicated that his blood alcohol content (BAC) was.286, which is almost three times the legal limit.</p><p>In the show, the family hired detectives who staged a recreation of the boating disaster in order to provide them with a full account of what transpired.

The convenience store that supplied Paul, then a minor, the alcohol that led to the accident was named as a defendant in Renee’s initial civil claim against Paul’s brother Buster, Paul’s father Alex Murdough, and the store.</p><p>Paul will not take responsibility for his acts, therefore the Beach family decided to go in a different direction.
