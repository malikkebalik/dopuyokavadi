His parents named him Stephen Gilchrist Clover when he was born on June 13th of 1974. His mother was Canadian and his father had English and American roots. The pair were living in England while his father was working for Pepsi-Cola. When Steve-O was six months old, he moved with his family to Brazil because his father had been promoted to president of Pepsi-Cola in South America.</p><p>Growing up in Brazil exposed the young Stephen Clover to new cultures and languages, and he has stated that his very first words were Portuguese. The family moved around frequently during Stephen's youth, and by the time he was two he had relocated to Venezuela. The boy then became fluent in Spanish. He lived in the United States for the first time when he moved to Miami at age six. He would only stay for three years, as the family moved once again to England when he was 9. After a three year spell back in his birthplace, he moved to Ontario, Canada for a year and then relocated back to London for a final time. This time, he was able to lay down his roots and spend four years attending an English high school.</p><p>After high school, Steve-O studied at the University of Miami. He dropped out soon afterward because of poor grades and instead chose to go to clown school. After three years, Steve-O worked professionally as a clown and filmed various stunts.</p><h2 id=breakthrough><strong>Breakthrough</strong></h2><p>Steve-O would regularly send tapes of his stunts to Big Brother, a skateboarding magazine. Unbeknownst to Steve-O, the person receiving these tapes was the future director of Jackass, <a href=# title="Jeff Tremaine Net Worth">Jeff Tremaine</a>. Tremaine saw the potential in Steve-O and brought him onto the Jackass team. The original MTV show aired in the year 2000 and ran for three seasons. The show was a massive success and Steve-O quickly became a fan-favorite.</p><p>The origins of Jackass are tied with the activities of other well-known Jackass figures. For example, professional skateboarder <a href=# title="Bam Margera Net Worth">Bam Margera</a> had begun filming his family, playing pranks, and performing stunts as early as 1999 with the release of CKY (Camp Kill Yourself). <a href=# title="Johnny Knoxville Net Worth">Johnny Knoxville</a> was another early pioneer of the Jackass format, as he was testing self-defense weapons and equipment on himself during this time.</p><p>Jackass was so successful that it spawned several spin-offs and sequels almost immediately.

The sequel, Jackass Number Two grossed almost $85 million on an $11.5 million budget. The third and final Jackass movie, Jackass 3D, grossed almost $172 million worldwide on a $20 million budget.

As early as 2002, Steve-O had been arrested for charges related to battery and obscenity. When he toured Europe with Bam Margera, Steve-O was jailed in Sweden for bringing drugs across the border. More arrests soon followed.</p><p>In 2006, Steve-O accelerated his drug use after being misdiagnosed with a rare heart condition.
