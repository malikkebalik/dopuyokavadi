So fans were definitely curious when <a href=# class=T3D>Drake released his song "Redemption" on <i>Views</i> </a>and name-dropped quite a few ladies who'd apparently scorned him, including an infamous Ericka who'd "sued him and opened a business." Yikes. Who is this Ericka, and is this name-check based on fact or fiction?</p><p>Though some of the names mentioned in the song are still a mystery (Sydney and Tiffany, for example, are hard to definitively pin down), Ericka seems to be a very real person from Drake's past. According to <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i>, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Ericka Lee is an ex-girlfriend</a> of Drake's that did, in fact, file a lawsuit against the rapper in 2012.</p><p>In the lawsuit, Lee claimed that she was the voice on the phone call in Drake's 2011 hit "Marvin's Room," and, according to <i>THR</i>, she sued him for allegedly not sharing co-writing royalties with her. She claimed Drake agreed to pay her for her contributions, as well as give her songwriting credits, but alleged that he did not do so.</p><p>In February 2013, TMZ reported that <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Drake and Lee came to an agreement</a> outside of court and the case was dismissed. Drake did not offer a public comment on the allegations.</p><p>But based on the lyrics in "Redemption," Drake still has the former relationship on his mind:</p>Ericka sued me and opened a business / Wonder if they wish it could've been different / Wonder what they'd do put in my position / I wonder, when my sh*t drop, do they listen? / Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions<p>The jury's still out on if she's listened to Drake's new album...</p><p><i>Image: <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Giphy</a></i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxygZhrbm1lp528brXSZpyroZOgrm6y0aikZpyilrimv4yrnJ2dnaXBqrvNZquhnV2rtqbD0maqqKaXYra0ecBmpaicXam8brTIrGSpmaOperOxy5qroqeeqLWqvNI%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
