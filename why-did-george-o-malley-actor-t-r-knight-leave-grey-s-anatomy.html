There was a traumatic issue with one of the other stars that seemed to ignite the flame that led to him leaving the <a href=#>TV</a> show.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_35>Fans may remember that, in 2007, Grey’s actor Isaiah Washington, who played Preston Burke, reportedly used a homophobic slur<strong> </strong>to refer to Knight while on set. After the incident, <a href=#>Washington was fired</a><strong> </strong>from the show.</p><p id=par-9_40>Knight’s decision to leave came two years after the incident. He cited a “breakdown in communication” with <a href=#>former showrunner Shonda Rhimes</a>, George’s decrease in screen time, as well as the conflict that forced him to publicly come out as gay.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_59>“There just comes a time when it’s so clear that moving on is the best decision,” Knight told <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a> in 2009. He reportedly left behind a $14 million contract. “There are a lot of people who would like to be in my position,” the actor continued. “But in the end, I need to be fulfilled in my work.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-knight-returned-to-grey-s-anatomy-as-george>Knight returned to ‘Grey’s Anatomy’ as George</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-11_48>If there were any hard feelings between Knight and the <a href=#>Grey’s Anatomy cast</a> and crew, they didn’t last long. He praised the show and those involved in an E! News interview in 2018. “It starts and ends with Shonda,” Knight said of the creator and former showrunner.</p><p id=par-12_43>“A lot of times, characters like George end up being one-dimensional,” he continued. “I think it was the combination of [Rhimes’] writing and this eclectic, weird group of actors [that makes the show]. Knight also noted how “the cast looked like real life.”</p><p id=par-13_45>In 2020, after more than a decade away, Knight returned to Grey’s Anatomy in season 17. <a href=#>George and Meredith</a> reconnected on her coma afterlife beach” in “You’ll Never Walk Alone.” They discuss his death, his funeral, and her illness — <a href=#>Meredith had coronavirus (COVID-19)</a>.</p><p id=par-14_45>Knight touched on his return after the episode aired. And he shared his affection for his co-star. “George and Meredith love each other, for sure, but I don’t think he can hold a candle to love I have for Ellen,” he wrote on <a href=#>Instagram</a>. &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS0s7HYrGSappGpvK7FjLCfnqqVYra0ecaepquflWK8brnApaOesV2jvLh5wKebZq%2BYrnqltcNmn55lnJqut7GMrZ%2BeZaOdvLh6x62kpWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
