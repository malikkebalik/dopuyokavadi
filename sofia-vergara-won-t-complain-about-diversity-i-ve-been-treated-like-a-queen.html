I’m not. I got a little bit tired of her a few years back, but I fell back in love with her during <a href=#>the drama last year with her ex</a>, Nick Loeb, a drama which has no end in sight. Sofia covers the new issue of The Edit, and she talks about a lot of the same stuff: accepting who you are, her giant rack, her hair, her red carpet styling and more. But she has thoughts about other stuff too, like diversity in entertainment and playing a stereotype. <a href=#>You can read the full piece here</a>. Some highlights:</p><p><strong>Stereotypes are not always bad:</strong> “I’m not afraid of them, and they don’t have to be bad, either. I mean, Gloria is an amazing character: a really good woman with this hilarious accent, so why criticize her for being a stereotype? Plus, all the Latinas I know are loud, they dress sexy and are really involved with their families: that’s Gloria!”</p><p><strong>She’s not Zen about aging: </strong>“Watching myself age on screen is awful! There is nothing more disturbing than watching an episode of Modern Family from the first season, then one from seven years later. It just makes me want to kill myself, but what can I do? I’ll be sad when the wolf whistles stop. I’m already sad that men have started calling me ‘Señora’. I get really pissed off: ‘What? It’s Señorita!’”</p><p><strong>How she’s changed in her 40s:</strong> “Back in my mum’s era, 40 was considered old, but now I don’t think it is. You have to accept that you can look beautiful, but in a different way. Nowadays I don’t do miniskirts and low-cut tops: it’s one or the other. I don’t do shorts or pink anymore, and I’ve softened my eye makeup. In Colombia, once women hit 40, they automatically cut their hair short. I used to think I would do that too, but when it came to it I thought, ‘Why should I f***ing cut my hair? It makes you look older!’”</p><p><strong>Motherhood:</strong> “I became a mother very young – at 20 – so I feel like I’ve been a mother my whole life, but I love that. Now that I’m 43 and my son is 23, it’s funny to see some of my girlfriends raising young kids. In the US, women postpone motherhood, but in Latin America most of my friends have kids my son’s age. I wouldn’t mind another child: my husband is younger than me and he wants kids so we’re trying to figure out what we’re going to do. The idea of doing it all again doesn’t scare me but, hey, it’s not like it’s going to happen naturally, is it?”</p><p><strong>Complaints about diversity:</strong> “I’m really not one to complain. I mean, seriously, how dare I! Here I am on prime-time television with this stupid accent, I can’t trash anyone. It would be so ungrateful of me because, trust me, I’ve been treated like a queen. Of course [the opportunities] can’t compare to an American or Caucasian woman’s, but things are changing. The problem is not the networks or directors: it’s that there aren’t enough writers creating things for Latinos. Once we have more Latinos writing, that’s when things may really start to change…”</p><p><strong>Her breasts:</strong> “My body has changed with age. People will often say that I wear the same thing on the red carpet, but I know my body: it’s very voluptuous and I’ve got the boobs of a stripper. They’re a 32DDD and because they’re real, they’re everywhere, so I need my dresses to have structure – and under armor. There is so much going on under my dresses that I bleed at the end of award ceremonies. In ten years I think it would be good to have a reduction. I don’t think it’s even going to be an option not to [have surgery], because I’m going to start having back pains. I wouldn’t make them too small – just enough that I don’t end up looking like an old stripper.”</p><p><strong>How she feels about being objectified:</strong> “I’ve never understood why women get so offended. I just don’t believe in all that drama, which is why I’ve made a whole joke out of it. I am secure enough not to take it all that seriously, and I like to laugh at myself.”</p><p><a href=#>[From The Edit]</a></p><p>I wouldn’t hold it against her if she did complain about diversity, because she seriously toiled away, looking for a break for more than a decade. Once she had a hit, she leveraged that into her own empire through her own hard work. As for the other stuff… here are my Hot Takes: you don’t have to cut your hair when you hit 40, but I disagree that a short haircut makes everyone look older. I don’t think it’s bad idea to say breast reduction might be in the future for Sofia: it might happen. Also, if your dresses make you bleed, you should choose different dresses!</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/vergara3.jpg alt=vergara3 width=590 sizes="(max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of The Edit.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbW5paoJ1e9KonaKZj6uys7PAq5iYr5%2BjwaCvzqanpZmZo6yirs6uq5icmauys7%2FIrbCYoaaarKOxxKeWraqVlsGmsL6loKSdj5asssHEnqVo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
