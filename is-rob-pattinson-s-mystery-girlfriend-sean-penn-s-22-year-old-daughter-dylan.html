Robin and Sean Penn’s son Hopper was in the news last year because it seems like he’s just as much of an anger-bear as his dad, but Sean and Robin’s daughter Dylan is rarely seen or spoken of. Sean and Robin did a good job with that for the most part – both kids grew up out of the Hollywood scene for the most part. Anyway, Dylan is a beauty, just like her mom. She’s 22 years old now and Dylan might have just scored the biggest boyfriend “get” of all time. Is Dylan dating Robert Pattinson?!</p><p>Kristen Stewart’s worst nightmare is confirmed — Robert Pattinson has finally moved on!</p><p>Life & Style can exclusively reveal that on Sept. 7, the 27-year-old Twilight star enjoyed a steamy night out at LA’s Viper Room with model Dylan Penn — the 22-year-old daughter of Sean Penn and Robin Wright!</p><p>An eyewitness tells the mag, on stands now, that in the club’s VIP Green Room, Robert wasn’t even watching the show; he only had eyes for his date. “They were touchy-feely and very flirtatious. There was a level of comfort there,” the fellow partygoer explains. “You could tell they’ve hung out a few times.”</p><p>But Rob better watch out! Dylan’s dad keeps a close watch on his model daughter. “Sean has really high standards for his kids,” says a friend. “Any guy who dates Dylan should watch his back and treat her right!”</p><p>After the show, Rob led Dylan to a waiting car, which whisked them to Chateau Marmont for drinks and french fries. From there, a group headed back to Rob’s home in an exclusive gated community. One onlooker exclusively tells Life & Style, “They went into his kitchen, and he put his arms around her. Then he was kissing her neck and talking all lovey-dovey. It was clear they’d been out together before.” When fellow guests left at 5 a.m., Dylan was still there.</p><p>Kristen is going to have to get used to her ex’s new leading lady — “He has finally moved on, for sure,” says one of Rob’s pals.</p><p><a href=#>[From Life & Style]</a></p><p>Is Dylan <a href=#>the “mystery girl”</a> that Rob was introducing as his girlfriend? Unknown. Is Rob that much of a player these days, where he would be seen with Dylan Penn at the Viper Room (ugh on the sparkly cliché) and then go out with a completely different girl to a party? I mean, it could happen. But I think it’s far more likely that Rob has a new girlfriend and it’s Dylan Penn. I hope Sparkles is prepared to have his face bashed in by Sean Penn’s Fists of Doom. Then again, I’m not sure that Sean really gives a crap about what his daughter does. He seems much more involved with his son’s life and (just my opinion), Dylan is more her mother’s daughter.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/wenn9907519.jpg alt title=wenn9907519 width=470 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/wenn20692518.jpg alt title=wenn20692518 width=480 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/wenn10153335.jpg alt title=wenn10153335 width=480 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/FFN_RIJ_EMMYS_2013_SET_1_092213_51215180.jpg alt title=FFN_RIJ_EMMYS_2013_SET_1_092213_51215180 width=530 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of Fame/Flynet and WENN.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbGpkboVze8islqunkpS9osDToqWsp56orK7F0q2cq7GPnLazuMWroJ6mlJTApq3NmKeepp6orHN%2BjLKcmqpdpLmlq8OarKCgpJq%2FoLDYpZinZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
