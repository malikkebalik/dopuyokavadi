The cast of the hit film franchise often had to contend with some pretty intense circumstances while shooting.

In fact, <a href=#>Robert Pattinson</a> once injured himself so badly, he couldn’t walk straight for a couple of weeks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Robert-Pattinson-and-Kristen-Stewart.jpg><p id=par-2_82>Pattinson, of course, portrayed moody vampire, Edward Cullen, in the Twilight movies. Because of his character, the actor was tasked with filming quite a few action scenes. This required him to stay in pretty good shape but, unfortunately, staying fit didn’t keep him from nearly tearing a muscle in his butt while filming Breaking Dawn –&nbsp;Part 2. Even after training consistently for three months, and getting in the best physical shape of his life, The Batman star still managed to hurt himself.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-robert-pattinson-injured-his-butt-while-filming-the-last-of-the-twilight-movies>Robert Pattinson injured his butt while filming the last of the ‘Twilight’ movies</h2><p id=par-3_104>While filming his very first scene in the last of the Twilight movies, Pattinson managed to put a massive amount of strain on his butt. In fact, the actor nearly tore his muscle and was required to get physical therapy. “We were doing the fight scene at the end of the first one, and I tore my glute — well, almost tore it, basically in my second shot of the whole movie, of the whole series,” Pattinson shared in a 2012 interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MTV</a>. “[They] had to get a physiotherapist to come in and massage my butt cheek for the rest of the day.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-4_96>But how exactly did Pattinson even managed to sustain such an unusual injury? In another interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ABC</a>, he shared that he was trying to pick up Kristen Stewart (who played Bella Swan in the Twilight movies) when he nearly tore his glute. “Just trying to be a superhero without proper training,” Pattinson joked when asked how he hurt himself. “I had to just pick up Kristen from squatting, and Kristen weighs probably 95 pounds or something, and somehow, I have no idea how managed to almost tear my hamstring when I was lifting her up.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-pattinson-wasn-t-the-only-cast-member-to-get-hurt-while-filming-breaking-dawn-part-2>Pattinson wasn’t the only cast member to get hurt while filming ‘Breaking Dawn –&nbsp;Part 2’</h2><p id=par-5_90>Not only did Pattinson have to get his butt massaged after filming the scene, but the injury also left him pretty sidelined. The actor shared that even after the massage, he couldn’t walk correctly for about a week or two. Funnily enough, Pattinson wasn’t the only one who injured himself while filming Breaking Dawn –&nbsp;Part 2. Stewart also managed to<a href=#> sustain a pretty serious injury while filming</a>. Clearly, filming the Twilight movies wasn’t always a cakewalk for the actors. But at least they were compensated handsomely for their hard work.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBuLXLop6hrF2nvKOx0a1kqZmkqbavv86nZJutpKl6rq3SrJignZRifm6%2Fwp6lnmaYqbqtew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
