It’s fantastic.”</p><p id=par-3_32>She added, “And the best part of it is I can make it in advance and just throw it in the oven before dinner so I can have fun with my friends.”</p><p id=par-4_35>She placed salmon filets skin-side down and sprinkled them with salt and pepper. Then Garten brushed mustard on each piece. “It gives it lots of flavor but it also helps the panko adhere,” she explained.</p><p id=par-5_37>Garten combined panko, parsley, lemon zest, salt, pepper, and olive oil then spooned the mixutre over each salmon piece and pressed it gently. “This is really one of my favorite ways to prepare salmon,” she shared.</p><p id=par-6_58>The Barefoot Contessa star added the salmon, skin side down, to a skillet with heated vegetable oil. “This is a great way to do it because when you sear it, you get the skin really nice and crisp and then you put it in the oven and roast it and it makes it moist and delicious,” she explained.</p><p id=par-7_51>The Food Network host seared the salmon for 3 to 4 minutes, then transferred the pan to a 425 degree Fahrenheit oven for 5 to 7 minutes. After removing the pan from the oven, Garten covered it with aluminum foil and allowed the salmon to rest for 5 to 10 minutes.</p><p id=par-8_10>The full recipe is available on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Food Network</a> website.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-garten-s-crispy-salmon-recipe-earns-5-star-reviews>Garten’s crispy salmon recipe earns 5-star reviews</h2><p id=par-9_46>Garten’s panko-crusted salmon is certainly a hit with her fans, based on the <a href=#>recipe’s 5-star reviews</a>. “This is an easy to make family favorite,” one fan wrote. Another commented, “Excellent flavor! Best combination of the Dijon and panko mix. This is a keeper in my kitchen.”</p><p id=par-10_17>Other reviewers called it the “best salmon ever,” “never fail,” and “so easy and delicious every time.”</p><p id=par-11_20>One enthusiastic reviewer commented, “This salmon gets 10 stars!!! Absolutely delicious. So fast and easy to make. Highly recommend it.”</p><p id=par-12_30>“This is our ‘go-to’ salmon recipe!
