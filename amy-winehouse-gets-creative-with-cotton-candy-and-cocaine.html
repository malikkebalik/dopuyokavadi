A source told the News of the World that the concoction came about when Amy’s friend, Babyshambles guitarist Mik Whitnall, suggested it as a joke after the singer bought a £700 candyfloss machine."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Throw in some Redbull and you’ve got yourself an all-week all-nighter.</p><p>A source told the News of the World that the concoction came about when Amy’s friend, Babyshambles guitarist Mik Whitnall, suggested it as a joke after the singer bought a £700 candyfloss machine.</p><p>The source explained: “It was Mik’s idea. The candyfloss machine was Amy’s pride and joy and he thought it would be funny to give it a boost.</p><p>“He and some pals sprinkled a wrap of coke into the mixture and Amy started eating it before she realised what they’d done. She now thinks it’s a hoot to do the same.”</p><p>[From <a href=#>Fametastic</a>]</p><p>Oh, yeah, what a hoot! Are these friends that are inventing new and even more destructive ways for Amy to take drugs the same friends that are on that 24-hour suicide watch? With friends like that who needs Blake?</p><p>It’s no surprise that these are the people who are surrounding Amy right now, birds of a feather and all, but these people aren’t friends. These people are users and abusers who are sticking around for the drugs, and to be able to say they were there when Amy Winehouse died.</p><p>Picture note by Celebitchy: Amy Winehouse is shown on 9/25/08 after performing at the End of Summer Ball. I hope she’s ok because we haven’t seen her since.
