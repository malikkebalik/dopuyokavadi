There were more comedic entries like Bride of and Seed of Chucky, and more atmospheric horror entries. Creator Don Mancini said he wanted the series to reflect Child’s Play 2 most of all.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Chucky-steals-a-cell-phone-at-a-talent-show.jpg><p id=par-2_46>Syfy and USA presented a San Diego Comic-Con@Home panel on “The Legacy of Chucky.” The panel included a more in-depth look at the upcoming series. Mancini and the cast also confirmed the show’s parallels to Child’s Play 2. Chucky premieres Oct. 12 on USA and Syfy.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-child-s-play-2-set-the-tone-for-chucky>‘Child’s Play 2’ set the tone for ‘Chucky’</h2><p id=par-3_48>After 1988’s Child’s Play, 1990’s Child’s Play 2 took an established killer doll and an Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) who’s already been through one murder spree.

Andy and Kyle, Alex Vincent and Christine Elise, fans really loved their relationship that we established in that movie. They have a really kind of brother/sister bond. Now with the TV series it was the perfect opportunity to dig into where those characters are now 30 years on.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-siblings-of-child-s-play-2-reunite-on-chucky>The siblings of ‘Child’s Play 2’ reunite on ‘Chucky’</h2><p id=par-5_39>Vincent returned as an adult in Curse of and Cult of Chucky while Elise returned in Cult. The TV series will give them a chance to really show how these foster siblings grew up together after defeating Chucky together.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_67>“I think the dynamic of having a teenage girl and a little boy fighting Chucky without any adults for protection was something that really resonated with the younger audience,” Elise said. “I get a lot of feedback on ‘I wish I had an older sister like Kyle.’ It also makes the inability to defeat Chucky easier to understand when it’s just two kids. It makes Chucky scarier.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Childs-Play-2-stars-Alex-Vincent-and-Christine-Elise-sit-on-a-Chucky-panel.jpg><p id=par-7_27>Vincent saw the appeal of Child’s Play 2.
