He attended the inauguration, thanks to tickets given to him by his cousin, Andrew Intrater, an American who is president of the investment company Columbus Nova. That company hired Cohen as a consultant in 2017.</p><p>Vekselberg has also had ties to other people in Trump's inner circle. In 2015, he attended the 10thanniversary celebration for the Kremlin's RT channel. At that event, <a href=#>Vladimir Putin</a> was seated next to <a href=# title="Michael Flynn Net Worth">Michael Flynn</a>.

His father was Jewish and some of Vekselberg's relatives were murdered as part of the Holocaust. Vekselberg graduated from the Moscow Institute of Transport Engineers in 1979. During the 1980s, he worked for a number of state run laboratories as a researcher.</p><p>Vekselberg's journey from mid-level management to one of Russia's richest men follows what is now a familiar trajectory: he took advantage of the fall of the Soviet Union. He went about buying parts of Russia's huge resource sector, which were carved up and privatized in the 1990s. He sold scrap copper from cable wires. Then he moved on to buying aluminum smelters in Siberia. Then he founded the oil and metals company Renova Group, which is headquartered in Switzerland. In 1997, he became a stakeholder in TNK-BP, a joint oil venture. In 2012 he sold his stake in the venture with the British oil giant to Rosneft, the Kremlin controlled oil behemoth.</p><p>Vekselberg is an art collector who collects Faberge eggs. In 2004, he purchased nine Faberge Easter eggs from the Forbes family for $900 million. He later established a museum to house the eggs. Vekselberg also spent a million dollars to move 17 Russian church bells back to Moscow from Harvard University. The bells were then consecrated by the head of Russia's Orthodox Church. Harvard got new bells.</p><p>Vekselberg is a prominent figure in Moscow's Jewish community. He gave money to set up the Jewish Museum and Tolerance Center. That museum opened in 2012. Two years later, <a href=# title="Ivanka Trump Net Worth">Ivanka Trump</a> and her husband <a href=# title="Jared Kushner Net Worth">Jared Kushner</a> attended a fund raising dinner at that museum.</p><p>Vekselberg met his wife Marina Dobrynina in college. She runs a charity that caters to people with psychological issues. They have a daughter Irina, born in 1979 and a son, Alexander, born in 1988. The Vekselberg kids attended Yale University. Alexander is an American citizen who also attended high school in the U.S. and now owns Ferrari dealerships in Philadelphia and Denver. Irina works for her father's Renova Group in Russia.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK7IpaOip56WtrOxjKecsKtfq7aswM6rZK%2Bdm6iyra7Eq55mmpWotqWx0makmqZdpa6qsIytqa6loGK5osPYnqlmpZmYtaKxy2aaqKCVo3p2fI9pZ2ln</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
