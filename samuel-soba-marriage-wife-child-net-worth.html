The marriage of Keri Hilson and Samuel Soba inevitably came along with the gossipy tidbits on Samuel’s wife in the town.

There are the least people who don’t know about the famous singer. The couple got together and dated for an extended period and walked down the aisle on March 17, 2002.&nbsp;It was a pretty close event, with the family and friends being a part of it.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Is Justine Ezarik Dating Her Boyfriend? iJustine Bio, Age, Height, Boyfriend, Net Worth 2019 >></a></h4><p>The couple is blessed with a son named <strong>Jayson,</strong> but there are rumors that Samuel is not the biological father. The talks also exemplify the fact that earlier, Keri had an interest in a guy <strong>Serge Ibaka</strong> who is Oklahoma city thunder center as well.</p><h2>Keri Hilson Songs</h2><ul><li>Breaking Point</li><li>Buyou</li><li>Change Me</li><li>Energy</li><li>Everything, Everyday, Everywhere</li><li>Get Your Money Up</li><li>Good Things</li><li>Got Your Back</li><li>Hero</li><li>Hey Now</li><li>I Like</li><li>In The Air</li><li>Knock You Down</li><li>Lose Control</li><li>Make Love</li><li>Medicine</li><li>Million Dollar Girl</li><li>Number One</li><li>Oh Africa</li><li>One Night Stand</li><li>Pretty Girl Rock</li><li>Return The Favor</li><li>Scream</li><li>She Don’t Wanna Man</li><li>Slow Dance</li><li>Superhuman</li><li>The Tide Is High</li><li>Turnin Me On</li><li>The Way I Are</li><li>The Way You Look Me</li></ul><h2>Most Recent Controversy</h2><p>As most people know, Samuel is someone who doesn’t like to hog any limelight or make any news. The news was made by Keri, who is seen as having <span style=font-size:1rem>some extramarital affair with </span><strong style=font-size:1rem>Serge</strong> <strong style=font-size:1rem>Ibaka</strong><span style=font-size:1rem>.</span></p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Noah Schnapp dating his Stranger Things’ co-star Millie Bobby Brown | Nillie’s Kiki Challenge >></a></h4><p>The pop star is seen with various boys and having a good time with other boys. The rumors have hit the market, saying that she has lousy marriage life, things don’t seem to go too well.</p><p>Apart from being married to Samuel, the pop star has dated Serge Ibaka from 2012 to November 2016. The list of the men goes one step further, and she dated <strong>Ricardo Lockette</strong> Seattle Seahawks player, in 2017.</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>One of the secretive personality, although being the husband of Keri, is surely Samuel Soba. The net worth, as we believe, is not much to talk about. Due to the lack of career information, nothing on the net worth can be shared with the general people.</p><p><span style=font-size:1rem>On the other hand, the net worth of Keri Hilson is undoubtedly high. It is basically from the singing career that has helped the lady amass a considerable amount. The name came along with the accumulation of net worth is much higher. The net worth made through it is</span> <strong>$25 million</strong>.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bernice Burgos Age, Bio, Daughter, Dating, Net worth >></a></h4><p>Although there is proper information on net worth, nothing accurate is available about the annual income and assets. The continuous association and hit numbers surely suggest the fact that the net worth of Keri will increase, and we hope the pop star meets the success stairs much well.</p><h2>Social Media Reach</h2><p>Samuel Soba is a silent individual who loves to live under the radar. The sharing of the information surely makes this point clear. No social media accounts make us even harder to provide day-to-day knowledge of his personal life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmispqi1sMPSrZirq16YvK570pqkrp2cYsCwrsBmmaKnXaKus77Imp6eZaees6Z5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8Gpew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
