Talking to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a> in December 2021 about their relationship and working with his then-girlfriend, Plemons said: “We fell in love creatively first on&nbsp;Fargo, just immediately trusted each other. I’m constantly amazed by what she brings. She just operates from such a deep place in her soul.”</p><p id=par-3_58>The pair then followed up their co-starring roles on Fargo with roles in 2017’s Black Mirror and 2018’s Drunk History. Most recently, the pair played a married couple in <a href=#>Jane Campion’s Oscar-nominated film, The Power of the Dog</a>. Both Dunst and Plemons received nominations for the film: Dunst for Best Supporting Actress and Plemons for Best Supporting Actor.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_46>From the red carpet at the 2022 Academy Awards, Dunst spoke about their nominations. “I was actually more, weirdly, excited for Jesse. I screamed,” she said, per People. “To be nominated together is the craziest thing. We just feel so lucky. We already won, you know?”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kirsten Dunst as a young star</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_59>Dunst broke out in the ’90s film scene with her role as Claudia in <a href=#>Interview with the Vampire</a> in 1994.

Since then, she has continued to be one of Hollywood’s top actors, starring in Bring It On, Spider-Man, Mona Lisa Smile, Wimbledon, Elizabethtown, <a href=#>Marie Antoinette</a>, Hidden Figures, and more.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jesse Plemons as a Hollywood ‘it’ guy</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_37>Coincidentally, Plemons too began acting at a young age as Hobo in 1998’s Finding North. The late ’90s and early 2000s saw Plemons in several projects, including Varsity Blues; Walker, Texas Ranger; and All the Pretty Horses.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_66>Largely considered his breakout role, Plemons joined Friday Night Lights as Landry Clarke in 2006.
