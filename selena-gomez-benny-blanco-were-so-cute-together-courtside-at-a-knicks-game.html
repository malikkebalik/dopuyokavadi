Of course, there was a bit of drama that followed because some of her fans initially disapproved. Selena shut all of that down pretty quickly, though, including addressing the fact that years earlier, Benny seemingly shaded her as a “cookie-cutter pop star” with a make-up line. At the time, he was working with Justin Bieber. Selena <a href=#>acknowledged the diss</a> over Instagram and made it clear that the comment did not bother her. Since then, they’ve been adorably gushy all over social media and at events.</p><p>Selena and Benny had a date night on Monday, where they went to see the NY Knicks play the Philadelphia 76ers at Madison Square Garden. They sat courtside alongside Sting, Chris Rock, <a href=#>Christopher “Zaddy” Meloni</a>, Ben Stiller, Ego Nwodim, and Cecily Strong. During date night, they packed on the PDA, kissing, cuddling, and taking selfies. Courtside at a big market basketball game feels like a celeb relationship rite of passage, no? Like, now they’re “courtside official.”</p><p>Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco are getting cozy courtside! The “Calm Down” singer and her music producer boyfriend were spotted on a date night at the New York Knicks vs. Philadelphia 76ers basketball game at New York’s Madison Square Garden on Monday, April 22, while joined courtside by Sting and an array of other star-studded attendees.</p><p>Gomez, 31, and Blanco, 36, were seen getting very close during the match as they also took the time to mingle with Sting, 72, who sat beside them. Other stars in attendance at the April 22 game were Chris Rock, Ben Stiller, Christopher Meloni, Carmelo Anthony and Saturday Night Live’s Ego Nwodim and Cecily Strong.</p><p>Gomez’s date night with Blanco comes after she shared photos of the pair on her Instagram Stories on April 12. In one snap, the couple kissed as the singer caressed Blanco’s neck with one hand, while he cradled her elbow. A second photo showed Blanco kissing Gomez’s hand as they took a joint selfie in a car.</p><p>An insider told PEOPLE earlier this month that Gomez and Blanco are said to be “so in love” after confirming their relationship in December 2023, adding that the two stars are in a “serious relationship.”</p><p>“They are so in love,” said the source. “It’s a very serious relationship, and they’re making long distance work while she’s in New York for work commitments.”</p><p>“Benny makes her feel special and they try to see each other as much as possible,” the insider continued. “She really does feel like it’s the best she’s ever been treated by a guy, and she’s had a certain glow since they started dating.”</p><p><a href=#>[From People]</a></p><p>Aww, good for Selena and Benny! I hope they had a blast during date night. I think they’re so cute together and hope Selena’s finally found someone who is the anti-Biebs and will treat her like she deserves. While Benny’s outfit is ridiculous, I kinda love his pants. Also, can we talk about Selena’s red trench coat (in the People photos, link below)? It’s super adorable. That color is magnificent. Apparently, colorful trenches are a thing this year. <a href=#>According to In Style</a>, Dua Lipa has a green one and Kendall Jenner recently wore a dark maroon one. Queer Eye’s Tan France said in an interview that trench coats/floor length jackets are, in fact, this spring’s big trend, so I guess we’ll all be on style alert to see what other celebrities start wearing them.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco Enjoy Loved-Up Basketball Date Night Courtside with Sting and Other Stars <a href=#>https://t.co/3Xk5qzKUHZ</a></p><p>— People (@people) <a href=#>April 23, 2024</a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/BGUS_2807960_003.jpg alt width=500 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos credit: CPR/D.Sanchez/Rio/BACKGRID</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmcW5oaoF5e9Keo56mkZS0sLnEs5abnZ6jxqCuy5qlnKePrLKzsb6sppibpamyoMDOoJytoJWnrKS71KurrKGUmqyiwL6alqSmmZi4tKvGmqSeZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
