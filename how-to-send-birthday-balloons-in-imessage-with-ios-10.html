Buckle up, friends, because I'm going to tell you <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>how to send birthday balloons in iMessage</a> and seriously change your birthday text game for good. Because you would have never known <a href=# class=T3D>you needed something like this</a>, but now that you have it, you won't be able to imagine your boring text life of the past that didn't include a massive birthday balloon shower attached to each congratulatory note.</p><p>The addition of animated text deliveries was one of the many new ways the iMessage experience was enhanced. So now, instead of just sending "Happy Birthday" or "Congratulations" with a bunch of emojis and exclamation points, you can send a message that will take over the recipient's entire screen when they read your message. It forces the recipient to stop what they're doing and take a moment to be celebrated — literally stop, because these balloons take over the entire screen!</p><p>And most importantly, it's so incredibly easy to use — <a href=# class=T3D>your new iMessage</a> does all the work for you. Here's how to use the super sweet and celebratory feature when typing "Happy Birthday":</p><h3>Enter The Phrase</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Yes, seriously, just type "Happy Birthday". You can add a name, an emoji, and an exclamation point, just make sure you have those two words.</p><h3>Hit "Send"</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Now all you have to do is wait. Once your recipient opens the text message and it registers as received, the animation will begin!</p><h3>It Will Look Like This</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Balloons everywhere! But just for a few seconds. It's long enough to be cut,e and short enough not to keep the recipient from whatever else they were doing on their phone.</p><p>Now, if you want to send balloons without a birthday message, say, to your roommate who finally finished all of her farmer's market produce before it became rotten mush on the fridge floor, you can do this:</p><h3>Type Any Message</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Whatever you want! It doesn't have to be congratulatory or birthday related. Type whatever your heart desires.</p><h3>Click "More"</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Then, before you send, you'll want to click this arrow. This will take you to a page where you can customize how your message appears, manually.</p><h3>Pick "Screen"</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p>You're looking for a full screen effect, so this is where you'll swipe. You can choose balloons...</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Or confetti...</p><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p>Or fireworks...</p><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p>Or lasers! Pick whatever you like and send it with flare. Never send a basic text again!</p><p><i>Images: </i>Somkiat Pimlue / EyeEm/EyeEm/Getty Images<i>,</i><i> Courtesy of Kaitlyn Wylde</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxyhJJqbG9lmKTEbsDOZqqeppRir6q%2B06GbmrFdl66tuM6opaxlmaN6qrnErKqan5VixKrAx2agqKtdZn0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
