That May, Sade performed its first US show at a New York City nightclub; the next year, the band signed with Epic Records.</p><h2 id=sade-8220diamond-life8221><strong>Sade and "Diamond Life"</strong></h2><p>After the record deal, Sade started working on its debut album, "Diamond Life."

"Diamond Life" was also a success internationally, landing at number one in numerous countries and entering the top ten in the US. With global sales of over six million copies, the album became one of the bestselling debut recordings of the decade, and the bestselling debut of all time by a British female vocalist.</p><p>"Diamond Life" produced a couple of hit singles. "Your Love Is King," the lead single, charted at number six on the UK Singles Chart. Another single, "Smooth Operator," became the album's most successful track in the US, placing at number five on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Adult Contemporary chart.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-205933 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Sade.jpg alt="Sade Net Worth" width=594 height=436 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-205933 class=wp-caption-text>VALERY HACHE/AFP/Getty Images</p><h2 id=8220promise8221-further-success><strong>"Promise" and Further Success</strong></h2><p>The band released its second album, "Promise," in 1985; reaching number one in the UK, it also became Sade's first album to peak at number one on the US Billboard 200.

The singer both starred in the film and provided her vocals to the soundtrack. Following this stint, Sade returned to the studio and released her third album with the band, "Stronger Than Pride," in 1988. It was another commercial triumph for the group, becoming certified three times platinum in the US and spawning four popular singles. One of the singles, "Paradise," became Sade's first to peak at number one on the US Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Success continued with 1992's "Love Deluxe," which sold 3.4 million copies in the US and became certified gold in the UK, and 1994's "The Best of Sade," a compilation album that hit the top ten in both the US and UK.</p><h2 id=8220lovers-rock8221-beyond><strong>"Lovers Rock" and Beyond</strong></h2><p>Coming off an eight-year hiatus, Sade released "Lovers Rock" in 2000, its fifth studio album. "Lovers Rock" reached number three on the US Billboard 200, and earned Sade the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album. A tour and a live album followed, both of which were highly successful. Afterward, Sade took another hiatus, this one for ten years, as she moved to the Caribbean and raised her son. She made a rare public appearance during this time to accept the honor of Order of the British Empire at Buckingham Palace.</p><p>In 2010, Sade came back with her sixth studio album, "Soldier of Love"; it became the group's first album to debut at number one on the Billboard 200. Among the album's singles were "Babyfather" and "The Moon and the Sky." The title track, meanwhile, won the Grammy for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.
