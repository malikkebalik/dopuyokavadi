Rodgers and Gardner went to see the New York Knicks play the Miami Heat in Game 2 of their series on Tuesday night 2 May.</p><p>Actress Jessica Alba, known for her roles in films including “Dark Angel,” “Fantastic Four,” and “Sin City,” was seated next to Rodgers on their flight. He informed Gardner of this and was somewhat taken aback by the latter’s reaction.</p><p>“He was just picking on me a little bit for being young,” <a href=# rel=noopener>Gardner said</a>. “You know, like, we was getting seated and he was like, ‘Oh, we’re about to sit by’ — what’s her name? — ‘We’re about to sit by Jessica Alba.’ I’m like, ‘Yeah, I don’t know who that is,’ and he looked at me like I’m crazy.</p><p>You know what I mean? It was just great being able to sit over there and I got to meet her and one of her friends who was from Detroit actually.</p><p>What I mean, do you think? It was wonderful to be seated next to her and to meet her companion, who was also from Detroit.</p><p>“It was great vibes, but that whole night, he would just keep asking me out of nowhere, ‘Do you know who that person is?’ and I’m like, ‘Bro, that’s Amar’e Stoudemire, I know who that is. Now you just picking on me at this point.'”</p><p>To be fair, Gardner is only 22, and Alba has been preoccupied with operating The Honest Company, an online shop she co-founded in 2011, rather than acting for the whole of his life. He explained that he had really seen her in movies before, he just hadn’t known her name at the time.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>.<a href=# rel=noopener>@AaronRodgers12</a> couldn’t believe <a href=# rel=noopener>@iamSauceGardner</a> didn’t know who <a href=# rel=noopener>@jessicaalba</a> was. 😅 (via <a href=# rel=noopener>@nyjets</a>) <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/6qOTQFZx3C</a></p><p>— NFL (@NFL) <a href=# rel=noopener>May 3, 2023</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Damnn it’s been 2 days and you still remember what I said word for word..
