The chain will also give players the opportunity to win an Arcade1Up "Pac-Man" machine cabinet.&nbsp;</p><p class=premium>In an interview with Insider, Pizza Hut's chief marketing officer, George Felix, explained the thinking behind the strategy.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p class=premium>"The idea behind Newstalgia was born out of listening to our customers and celebrating all the things they associate with and love most about the brand," he said. "Whether it's the Tiffany lamps, arcade games, the red cups, the red-and-white checkered tablecloth or, of course, our iconic pizzas – and fusing those timeless equities with modern innovations, as seen with the partnership with Pac-Man and limited-edition AR box."</p><p class=premium>To help amplify the campaign, Pizza Hut partnered with actor, comedian, and new spokesperson, Craig Robinson, for a TV commercial. In the spot, he is shown playing "Pac-Man" while chowing down on a $10 Tastemaker pizza.&nbsp;</p><p class=premium>Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc owns the licence to the Pac-Man character, and Yutaka Fuse, the company's head of licensing and branding, recently discussed the Pizza Hut collaboration.<a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow>&nbsp;He told Food and Wine: </a>"Pac-Man's design and creation was inspired by the shape of a pizza with a slice taken out of it, making this partnership so appropriate for the Pac-Man brand."</p><p class=premium><a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow>Yum!, the corporation that owns Pizza Hut, recently reported the chain's q4 earnings, which showed same-store sales rose 8% in the quarter.</a> This marked the best quarterly performance for Pizza Hut in 10 years, Felix said.
