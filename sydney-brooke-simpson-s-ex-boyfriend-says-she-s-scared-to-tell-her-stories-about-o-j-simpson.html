Simpson fathered five children</a> — three with his first wife, Marguerite Whitley, and two with his second wife, Nicole Brown Simpson. Sydney Brooke Simpson was born on Oct. 17, 1985, and was just 8 years old when her mother died. Justin Ryan Simpson was born on Aug. 6, 1988, and was 5 when his mom died.</p><p id=par-3_64>Sydney built a robust life for herself despite the media attention on her mother’s violent death. Stuart Alexander Lee, Sydney’s boyfriend from 2007 to 2012, spoke to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Radar Online</a> in 2019 about how Sydney feels about the situation decades after it occurred. He told the publication, “She works very hard,” as she graduated from Boston University and then moved to Atlanta, Georgia, with Lee.</p><p id=par-4_16>Overall, Lee expressed that Sydney didn’t want to speak out about O.J. or her mother’s murder.</p><p id=par-5_47>“She doesn’t understand that her story could help someone else,” Lee said. “When I was with her, I got friends in the industry I tried to set her up with, and she said fame is a scary thing. It’s so real to tell&nbsp;your side of the story.”</p><p id=par-6_28>“Everybody contacts her to speak out,” he continued. “She could be an inspiration to so many people, but she’s scared. She doesn’t understand. Hopefully, one day she will.”</p><p id=par-7_65>Lee added that Sydney didn’t believe her father committed murder. “They speculate that it was a drug deal gone bad,” he said. ” … Sydney doesn’t believe O.J. did it, but&nbsp;she doesn’t know what to believe. The media changes, and how the police changed the whole situation. … Either way, her mother died.” Lee noted that Sydney maintained a relationship with O.J. through the years.</p><p id=par-8_24>Ultimately, Lee and Sydney broke up because of Lee’s demanding career in the music industry. “There’s no hard feelings on either side,” he said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-o-j-simpson-said-he-didn-t-discuss-the-murders-with-his-kids>O.J.

Simpson spoke to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Associated Press</a> about where he stands with his kids. According to O.J., he had a great relationship with his family and frequently stayed in touch with his children after his prison release.</p><p id=par-10_7>“Life is fine,” he told the publication.</p><p id=par-11_46>While O.J. was acquitted of murder charges, he was convicted of two counts of robbery with a deadly weapon, two counts of assault with a deadly weapon, one count of conspiracy to commit burglary, and one count of burglary with a firearm over a decade later.</p><p id=par-12_69>O.J. added that <a href=#>he didn’t discuss Nicole’s murder with his kids</a>, as none of them wanted to relive that day. “We don’t need to go back and relive the worst day of our lives,” he explained. “The subject of the moment is the subject I will never revisit again. My family and I have moved on to what we call the ‘no negative zone.’ We focus on the positives.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-is-sydney-brooke-simpson-now>Where is Sydney Brooke Simpson now?</h2><p id=par-13_46>O.J.
