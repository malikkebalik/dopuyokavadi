Played by David Dastmalchian, he’s a supervillain whose mother haunts him wherever he goes. Her sudden appearances everywhere affected his focus, but they were also some of the most comical scenes in the movie."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Interestingly, the actor behind Polka Dot Man’s mother had no idea who she’d be playing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/polka-dot-man-suicide-squad.jpg><h2 id=h-polka-dot-man-had-a-traumatic-childhood>Polka Dot Man had a traumatic childhood</h2><p id=par-3_40>Though he’s known as one of Batman’s adversaries, fans learned Polka Dot Man’s backstory in James Gunn’s The Suicide Squad. As a child (whose real name is Abner Krill), his scientist mother subjected him and his siblings to cruel experiments.</p><p id=par-4_31>Her employment at S.T.A.R. Labs enabled her access to otherworldly compounds and viruses, but her obsession with superheroes turned her into a mad scientist who used her kids as guinea pigs.</p><p id=par-5_66>Krill saw some of his siblings die, and his need to purge his polka dots is a side effect of the virus that created them. His mother is responsible for his state. Based on his recurring hallucinations of her in his adult life, it’s assumed he may have killed her. Polka Dot Man’s aversion to murder is only abated when he imagines her as the target.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><h2 id=h-lynne-ashe-stole-the-suicide-squad-show-as-polka-dot-man-s-mom>Lynne Ashe stole ‘The Suicide Squad’ show as Polka Dot Man’s mom</h2><p id=par-6_46>There are several sequences in The Suicide Squad where Mama Krill pops up. At one point, she takes the form of every villain in the crew, including Rick Flag, <a href=#>King Shark</a>, Peacemaker, and Bloodsport. Before his crushing death, Polka Dot Man envisioned Starro as his mother.</p><p id=par-7_37>Lynne Ashe is the woman behind the hilariously haunting character, and the Georgia native explained to Empire magazine that she didn’t know much about her role. Ashe never received a script or any notes about her character.</p><p id=par-8_49>Her audition only involved busting out some dance moves, and when she showed up to film, Gunn instructed her on how to move and stand. For one character, they told her, “Okay, you’re a shark and you’re being distracted by a butterfly.” Fans can figure out what that meant.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-9_62>“I think in total I had 22 costumes,” she said. “Which is highly unusual and has never happened to me before. And probably never will again.” Ashe remembered the “Starro scene” where she had to pretend someone was attacking her. She punched, looked down and around, and fought. But she “didn’t know I was going to be five stories tall, punching buildings!”</p><p id=par-10_31>When Ashe finally saw the movie, she had no idea whether she would be in it. However, she was thrilled to see the finished product. “I was stunned, amazed, and honored.”</p><h2 id=h-ashe-s-current-roles-include-dopesick-and-stargirl>Ashe’s current roles include ‘Dopesick’ and ‘Stargirl’</h2><p id=par-11_47>Fans can stream The Suicide Squad and relive Polka Dot Man’s experiences with his mother. But Ashe can be seen in Hulu’s Dopesick, Horror Noire, and CW’s Stargirl. During an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Boss</a>, she teased that fans may see more of her in the DC universe.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEsLnAp2SwoJ9iva2t2J6bZqifobiiecOoq2alkaPAbrnOpmSsrZmYtqWxjKyorpmUYrGqsM2tZKSmn6x6s7vLnmSupqSeuW6%2Fx55krJmnYrqwwsieZaGsnaF8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
