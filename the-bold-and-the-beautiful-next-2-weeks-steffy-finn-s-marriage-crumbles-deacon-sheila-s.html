reveal</a> that the Sheila Carter (Kimberlin Brown) situation is about to erupt into a firestorm of drama, so let’s talk about what’s in store.</p><p>During the week of May 6-10, Deacon Sharpe (Sean Kanan) and John “Finn” Finnegan (Tanner Novlan) will celebrate Sheila’s survival as they work to convince her things are going to be different this time around.</p><p>Finn has changed his tune when it comes to accepting Sheila, so he’ll reiterate that he wants her in his life and isn’t going to push her away.</p><p>Likewise, Deacon won’t be worried about the naysayers or any opinions other than his own.</p><p>Although Deacon pumped the brakes on marriage shortly before Sheila disappeared, he won’t want to do that anymore.</p><p>Deacon will be ready for the next step in his romance with Sheila, so it sounds like he’ll propose again and assure Sheila that he wants her to be his wife.</p><p>Although Deacon will be over the moon to have Sheila back by his side, Hope Logan (Annika Noelle) will freak out when she appears at Deacon’s apartment and comes face to face with Sheila herself.</p><p>It looks like Hope will pass out or at least come close, so she’ll definitely have a strong reaction to this “ghostly” encounter.</p><p>Once Sheila greets Hope and Deacon calms his daughter down, Finn will help him explain the “Sugar” aka Janet Webber (Kimberlin Brown) swap mess.</p><p>Hope will find out Sheila has been stuck in captivity and wasn’t the one who went after Steffy Forrester (Jacqueline MacInnes Wood) that night at the cliff house.</p><p>After Steffy and Liam Spencer (Scott Clifton) spend a little more time reconnecting, Steffy will finally meet back up with Finn.</p><p>That’ll give Finn a chance to share a wild story about Sugar, Sheila and the 10 toes that changed everything!</p><p>Steffy will be in total disbelief at first, but Finn will insist Deacon was right and that Sheila was trapped in an abandoned building when they found her.</p><p>Although Finn will think Sheila’s survival is a good thing, Steffy will feel like her world is crashing down around her.</p><p>Since Steffy’s Sheila nightmare will suddenly start back up, she’ll act like Finn’s giving her the worst news ever.</p><p>Finn will try to convince Steffy that Sheila has changed and that she’d never target her the way Sugar did – not at this point in her life.</p><p>Nevertheless, Steffy won’t be able to forget Sheila’s past mistakes and will consider her to be incredibly dangerous.</p><p>Back with Sheila, she’ll have a tense interaction with Li Finnegan (Naomi Matsuda).</p><p>Whether Finn gives his adoptive mom the heads-up or not, Li’s going to face off with Sheila and wish her enemy had stayed deceased!</p><p>During the week of May 13-17, B&B spoilers say more people will get updates on Sheila being alive and well.</p><p>That’ll surely include Bill Spencer (Don Diamont), who’ll fume over Sheila’s return and may wonder if he should do something about it.</p><p>As for Finn and Steffy, they’ll face some extreme marriage problems.</p><p>The more Finn tries to convince Steffy that Sheila deserves a fresh start, the angrier Steffy will become about his stance.</p><p>Steffy will feel like Sheila has totally pulled the wool over Finn’s eyes, so she’ll try to give him a wake-up call about what Sheila’s still capable of.</p><p>Finally, RJ Forrester (Joshua Hoffman) and Luna Nozawa (Lisa Yamada) still need to figure out what the future holds.</p><p>Luna wants to move forward with RJ, but will he be able to put her drugged encounter with Zende Forrester Dominguez (Delon de Metz) behind him?</p><p>The Bold and the Beautiful spoilers say the next two weeks will bring some curveballs, so stick with us for more predictions on all the twist and turns.</p><p>CDL’s where you want to be for exciting <a href=# rel=noopener>Bold and the Beautiful spoilers, predictions, updates and news, so make us your one-stop B&B source.</a></p><p></p><p class=postsid
