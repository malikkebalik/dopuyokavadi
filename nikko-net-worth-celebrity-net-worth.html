The relationship provided much drama for the series, as Nikko was often quite vocal about his dislike for Mimi Faust's ex-boyfriend, successful producer, <a href=#><strong>Stevie J</strong></a>. Nikko called Stevie J out during multiple interviews and questioned his ethics and business acumen. Mimi Faust ultimately broke off her relationship with Nikko during the last episode of the season, after she found out that he attempted to hit on one of her fellow cast members. "Love and Hip Hop: Atlanta", a spin-off of the original, "Love and Hip Hop", debuted in 2012 and its sixth season premiered in 2017.</p><p>In April 2014, Nikko made headlines when it was revealed that a sex tape of him with Mimi Faust was released to the public. The pair claimed that their luggage had been stolen with the sex tape inside and was made public by an anonymous source. However, the two stars later revealed that it was staged after all. The sex tape, "Scandal in Atlanta," ended up being a major plot line in future seasons of Love & Hip Hop. Released by Vivid Entertainment, it became one of the most popular sex tapes ever released by that company and was nominated for a 2015 AVN Award for Best Celebrity Sex Tape.</p><p>Nikko also appeared in the reality TV series Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Prior to his partnership with Mimi Faust, Nikko got married to Margeaux Simms in 2007.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq97z6umna2Tmr%2B0e82ioqSnXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
