Under the label, he put out a lot of mixtapes. He soon put out songs that gained a good amount of attention, including singles and features with rappers like Lil Yachty&nbsp;and Young Thug. The rapper’s first major hit was “My Dawg, which reached No. 71 on the&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;Hot 100 chart.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-3_77>In 2018, his popularity continued to ascend and he really made it to mainstream status when he released “Yes Indeed,” featuring Drake. It reached No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song was also included on his first album,&nbsp;Harder than Ever, in 2018. Lil Baby put out three projects in 2018. The others were two mixtape:&nbsp;Drip Harder&nbsp;(with Young Thug) and&nbsp;Street Gossip.&nbsp;Drip Harder featured the single “Drip Too Hard,” which reached No. 4 on the Hot 100.</p><p id=par-4_61>2019 saw Lil Baby with two huge hits in “Baby” (featuring DaBaby) and “Woah.” In 2020 he released the album&nbsp;My Turn, which topped the Billboard top 200 albums chart. Pretty much song from the album appeared on the Billboard Hot 100. The song included the hit song, “Woah.” A deluxe edition of the My Turn was also released in 2020.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-everything-we-know-about-lil-baby-s-education>Everything we know about Lil Baby’s education</h2><p id=par-5_36>Lil Baby did not attend college. He attended high school at Booker T. Washington High School in Atlanta. Last year, he surprised students at the school and revealed that he would be establishing a scholarship.</p><p id=par-6_60>“A majority of the students in these neighborhoods, when they have good grades most of them don’t have support,” he said in an interview with <a href=#>Billboard</a>. “They don’t have a family who can afford to [send them] to a good college or the college they want to go to,” Lil Baby explained. He wants this to be an annual fund.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_79>Lil Baby also spoke about returning to the high school and making such a big impact on the students. “From the time I left here to now, I’ve had a crazy journey,” he said.“Just to be able to come back on a positive note and actually touch this ground again and see some of these faces again… I can’t even explain it. I was once in a state where I knew for sure I wasn’t ever coming back here.</p><p id=par-8_102>Dan Sims, an associate superintendent of Atlanta Public Schools, also gave kudos to Lil Baby in the Billboard piece. “It’s crazy that these people did amazing things for their time and their people,” he said. “To watch these students respond to Lil Baby, their artist—and I love him, too—is just so gratifying. We’re thinking years from now, what will the history say about Booker T. Washington High School. There will be this story about Lil Baby, Dominique Jones, who gave back, started this scholarship fund, attended this school [previously] and gave to the lives of other individuals. That is huge for us.”</p><p id=par-9_22>It is great to see a celebrity give back to their community and help young folks have access to education funding.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSxqrCMpaClZZKWr7p5xqhkraddmLytuMSgnGegpKK5cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
