In “Better Than Revenge (Taylor’s Version), the line is now: “He was a moth to the flame, she was holding the matches.”</p><p data-characters=128 data-current-count=527 data-injectable=true>So now that the bad blood between Taylor Swift and Camilla Belle has seemingly been shaken off, what is Belle up to these days?</p><h2 id=h-who-is-camilla-belle data-injectable=false>Who is Camilla Belle?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GettyImages-1097932024-1.jpg><p data-characters=525 data-current-count=825 data-injectable=true>For those who need a total recap, Camilla Belle is an American actress whose Hollywood career dates back almost 30 years. Now 37 years old, Belle broke out as a child performer in the mid-to-late 1990s, appearing in such hit films as 1995’s The Little Princess, 1997’s The Lost World: Jurassic Park, and 1998’s Practical Magic. Infamously, Belle’s film career somewhat took a hit after 2008’s 100,000 BC, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">widely regarded as the worst movie of blockbuster director Roland Emmerich’s career</a>.</p><p data-characters=430 data-current-count=430 data-injectable=true>Ironically, this was around the time that Belle was dating Jonas. Their relationship lasted from around late 2008 to mid-2009, after they first met when Belle appeared in the Jonas Brothers’ music video for “Lovebug.” Prior to her time with Jonas, Belle dated British actor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Sturridge</a>, now best known for Netflix’s The Sandman, from 2006 to 2008. She’s not known to be dating anyone at this time.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What movies and TV shows have Camilla Belle appeared in lately?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GettyImages-1242814868-1.jpg><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=682 data-injectable=true>Although she’s less likely to turn up in a major studio movie these days, Belle has nevertheless maintained a solid and steady film and TV career over the past 15 years. For starters, she’s appeared in numerous indie/mid-budget movies in the years since, including the 2015 western Diablo, opposite Scott Eastwood, and the 2017 thriller The Mad Whale with James Franco.</p><p data-characters=385 data-current-count=385 data-injectable=false>You may also have seen her in recurring roles on TV series such as Dollface and Law & Order: Organized Crime. On Law & Order: Organized Crime, she plays an important and fan-favorite character, Pearl Serrano. Serrano is a former casino owner and the ex-wife of Teddy Silas. She was a crucial part of season 3 and fans are hopeful she’ll return to the show at some point.</p><p data-characters=330 data-current-count=715 data-injectable=true>Following the Netflix action flick Carter, however, which was released in August 2022, Belle has yet to make any further screen appearances at the time of writing. It’s unclear why that is, but a glance at her Instagram account will tell you that she’s doing well and there’s no reason for concern for her fans.</p><p data-characters=254 data-current-count=254 data-injectable=false>That said, Belle did suffer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the loss of her dog, Evolet, in March 2023</a>, which she described as “excruciatingly painful.” Elsewhere, Belle has been continuing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">her partnership with the Motion Picture & Television Fund NextGen organization</a>.</p><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=538 data-injectable=true>Belle is very involved in charity work, supporting organizations such as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Artists for Peace and Justice</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kids With A Cause</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital</a>. She has also been vocal about her support for the SAG-AFTRA strike and has been spotted joining in with a sign.</p><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=229 data-injectable=false>While Taylor Swift might’ve indirectly buried the hatchet, some shade-filled comments Camilla Belle has made on social media in the past indicate she may not be spotted <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cheering Taylor on during the Eras Tour</a> anytime soon.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=529 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>@katyperry</a> Couldn't have said it better…</p>— Camilla Belle (@CamillaBelle) <a href=#>July 23, 2015</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=qme dir=ltr><a href=#>#quoteoftheday</a> <a href=#>#HappyMonday</a> <a href=#>#felizsegunda</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/c7keaidXG5</a></p>— Camilla Belle (@CamillaBelle) <a href=#>July 18, 2016</a></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZp%2BaqKCau6awjK2mZpuRoratuMBmmZ6knJp8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
