After the second day, she bonded with Nicole Franzel, and Devin Shepherd brought her into the massive Bomb Squad alliance without the other members’ knowledge.</p><p id=par-3_35>Once Shepherd got evicted, Varner joined the other majority alliance, The Detonators. She worked with the group for several weeks and then began playing both sides when she wanted to get ally Zach Rance evicted.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-4_41>However, he found out about her master plan and turned on her first, resulting in her eviction. The barista placed sixth in the competition. During her time in the house, the then-married 23-year-old flirted with ally Cody Calafiore, creating online controversy.</p><p id=par-5_22>Following her eviction, she walked out of the front house to Julie Chen Moonves and an angry audience who loudly booed her.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Christine Varner opens up about ‘Big Brother 16’ experiences</strong></h2><p id=par-6_26>Now at 29 years of age, Varner has reflected on her time during&nbsp;BB16. Shortly before&nbsp;BB22&nbsp;premiered, she returned to social media and began answering questions from fans.</p><p id=par-7_53>Someone asked how she felt when the audience booed her, and the&nbsp;BB16&nbsp;star claimed two men booed her with everyone else following suit. According to Varner, the guys apologized to her after the show and told her they were there to boo Frankie Grande because they thought he would leave the house that night.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter" id=emb-3><p lang=en dir=ltr>Sadly I don’t have much memory of the years I was married, and Big Brother is in there.

After CBS announced the&nbsp;All-Stars&nbsp;season, Varner posted a heartfelt message to <a href=#>Instagram</a> as she expressed disappointment about not receiving an invitation to return.</p><p id=par-9_27>She admitted she’s “utterly jealous” of others who had positive experiences on the show and wanted to become another Janelle Pierzina who’s returned a record four times.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Christine Varner doesn’t regret appearing on the show</strong></h2><p id=par-10_24>Even though Varner stated she was jealous of those who had positive experiences, she revealed she doesn’t regret&nbsp;BB&nbsp;at all in an August 2020 tweet.</p><p id=par-11_44>The&nbsp;BB16&nbsp;star continued and explained she’s grateful for the experience because it gave her the “strength” to leave an unhappy marriage. Additionally, the 29-year-old noted she’s “grateful” for the hate she received because the “rough time” she went through inspired her to become a therapist.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter" id=emb-4><p lang=en dir=ltr>I think I’ve finally decided I 100% don’t regret <a href=#>#BB</a>; It gave me the strength to leave my husband. I’m actually grateful I was hated too, if I didn’t have such a rough time I think I wouldn’t have gone down the path of becoming a therapist, and potentially helping so many others.</p>— Christine Varner (@MeanyChristiney) <a href=#>August 25, 2020</a></figure><p id=par-12_33>One fan pointed out that her life would have gone differently had she not appeared on&nbsp;Big Brother, and Varner agreed, noting she’d probably have a child with her ex and “felt stuck forever.”</p><p id=par-13_30>Currently, the&nbsp;BB16&nbsp;star is in school for therapy as she wants to help others who are going through a hard time.&nbsp;Big Brother 22: All-Stars&nbsp;airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on CBS.</p><p id=par-14_4>Follow Tamara Grant on&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Twitter</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvqrOMm6morJiav26vx6ugrKyZo7JuwsCrpZ6qXZy%2FosDEn6ylZZaWu7R5x5qrnpxdnbKzesetpKVn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
