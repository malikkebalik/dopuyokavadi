And according to Cattrall, at the time, showrunners didn’t prioritize actors’ safety during sex scenes as they do now.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_46>“I never had an intimacy coach,” Cattrall told <a href=#>Variety</a>. “On Sex and the City, the most I ever got was for Pat Field to make this — she called it a ‘K.C. Cup’ that would cover, like a jockstrap, both actors if the scene required it.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_50>“The K.C. Cup — Kim Cattrall!,” she continued. “Because some guys had never acted before. It was their first job. And they were nervous something might happen. But now, there’s a person on set every time there’s an intimacy scene, and you’re protected. It’s a much safer place to be.”&nbsp;</p><h2>Why Kim Cattrall won’t do nude scenes anymore</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Sex-and-the-City-star-Kim-Cattrall-speaks-on-a-TCA-panel.jpg><p id=par-7_62>After the second Sex and the City movie, Cattrall left the franchise and did not appear in the&nbsp; 2022 reboot, <a href=#>And Just Like That</a>. In her chat with Variety, the actor talked about where her career is now — she’s on two new series, Queer as Folk and How I Met Your Father — and revealed why she’s over filming nude scenes.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_36>“I don’t want to be nude anymore,” Cattrall said. “I’m 65. I’m in great shape. But I’m just not interested. I feel like I filled my quota on that one — and without an intimacy coach.”</p><h2>But she still looks back fondly on her ‘Sex and the City’ role</h2><p id=par-9_20>Cattrall is done playing Samantha Jones. And she’s been open about <a href=#>not wanting to return</a> for And Just Like That.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_25>But the actor still looks back at her Sex and the City role fondly. And she’s proud of the work she did on the show.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_38>“There were so many parallels of me growing as an actor and that character,” Cattrall told Variety.&nbsp; “I would never want to look back on that with anything other than pride. That I did that, that it existed.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-12_43>When talking about how much fans want to see her reprise the role, Cattrall added, “This feels like an echo of the past, other than the really wonderful feeling of — it’s rare in my business — people wanting more, especially at 65.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-13_25>“That feels powerful, that I’ve left something behind that I’m so proud of,” she continued. “I loved her. I loved her so, so, so much.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTApsSMmqWdZaSdsm6vyK2wZqOZonqkrdOtqZqknGLEsLrTZpuoZZ6qsaZ50pycp52jYq6vxcyoqZ5mmKm6rXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
