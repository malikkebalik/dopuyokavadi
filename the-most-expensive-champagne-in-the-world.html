Celebrities and politicians now take "selfies" clutching the latest popular type of champagne.&nbsp; Champagne producers go out of their way to emphasize the elite quality of their particular champagne in all of their advertising.&nbsp; Expensive champagnes make headlines, and 2013's most expensive champagne, was no exception.&nbsp; The Gout de Diamant Brut Diamond Champagne costs a jaw-dropping <strong>$1.2 million</strong>.&nbsp; The champagne inside the bottle was produced by Chapuy, and is said to have a floral, creamy texture, with a "light and elegant finish".&nbsp; While the beverage, made from a combination of grand cur chardonnay, pinot noir, and pinot meunier grapes may be lovely (Gout de Diamants was chosen as "Best Taste" in 2012 by Champagne Business News), it is actually the bottle itself that is the reason for the hefty price tag.&nbsp; Designed by U.K. luxury designer, Alexander Amosu, the bottle features the Gout de Diamant logo in white gold.&nbsp; Traditionally, a Swarovski crystal has rested within the logo, but for this particular bespoke line, the crystal has been replaced by a single, 19-carat, deep-cut white diamond.&nbsp; The label is also made from 18-carat solid white gold, and the bottle owner's name is engraved in it.&nbsp; Each bottle is crafted by hand.&nbsp; If a handcrafted bottle of wine is not a status symbol, I don't know what is.&nbsp; If you had the option of dropping a million plus on something, would you drop it on a diamond studded bottle of champagne?&nbsp; Let me know.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLTOsGSmrZOdeqW7xKxmnrCgmru0tdWeZJunpKm5pnnCoZimqJGcu6Z51qippZxf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
