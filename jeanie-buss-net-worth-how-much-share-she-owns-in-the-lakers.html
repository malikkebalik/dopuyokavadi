It works out to about 11 percent of the Lakers for each child.

Eventually, Jerry Buss and his partner Frank Mariani established a real estate investment firm called Mariani-Buss Associates.</p><p>Jerry’s divorce from Joann had already left Joanie suffering deeply. In spite of this, she never stopped speaking highly of her relationship with her dad. Around this period, Jerry began amassing a slew of local Los Angeles-area sports franchises. The Los Angeles String Quartet, the Los Angeles Kings hockey team, and the Los Angeles Lakers were among these. She began accompanying Jerry to World Team Tennis meetings when she was only 14 years old, where she gleaned invaluable experience that she would use as manager of the Los Angeles Strings. <strong>She made the decision to move in permanently with her dad when she was 17.</strong></p><h2>Jeanie Buss’s Career</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Jeanie-Buss-Career.jpg><p>Jeanie went to school while she was learning the business and sports management ropes from her dad.

For $2.45 million in 2017, she bought the house. She agreed to a price reduction of $225,000 despite the fact that the original asking price was $225,000 higher. To be fair, after purchasing the property two years ago, Buss did make some improvements in an effort to increase its desirability to potential buyers. Before re-listing, the home was given a brief facelift with a coat of neutral paint and updated light fixtures.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Jeanie-Buss-Property.jpg><p>Her previous Playa Vista residence, located on a corner site, has over 3,200 square feet of total living space.
