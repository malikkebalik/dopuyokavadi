The movie is the official remake of Band Baaja Baarat. Starring the super talented Nani and Vaani Kapoor, this film is directed by debutante Gokul Krishna. Aha Kalyanam has hit the screens today and let’s see how it is.</p><p><strong>Story :-</strong></p><p>Shakti(Nani) is an aimless graduate, who does not know what to do with his life. One fine day, he meets Shruthi(Vaani Kapoor) at a wedding and becomes friends with her. Shruthi is an ambitious girl, who wants to start up her own wedding planning company.</p><p>One day, Shakti’s dad urges him to come back to his village and take care of their family business. In order to avoid his dad, Shakti lies to him that he is doing wedding planning as a business. In order to make his lie a truth, he meets Shrtuhi and requests her to make him her partner in the wedding planning business.</p><p>Shakti starts pestering Shruthi, and after a lot of deliberation, she agrees to partner with Shakti. They launch a wedding planning company called Getti Melam. As time passes by, their company becomes a huge success and Getti Melam becomes the talk of the town.</p><p>One fine day when Shruthi and Shakthi are celebrating their success, a small incident changes the dynamics of their personal relationship and both part ways..</p><p>What is that incident ? What happens to their business ? Will the couple get back together ? For all these answers you need to watch this film on big screen.</p><p><strong>Plus Points:-</strong></p><p>If Band Baaja Baarat was both Anushka and Ranveer’s show, Aha Kalyanam is undoubtedly Nani’s show all the way. His Tapori act and the way he has carried off his character is spell binding. Not even once, does one get reminded of Ranveer Singh from the original. He has tried his best to make this film tick.</p><p>Vaani Kapoor is definitely a find, and does well for her first film down south. She had a difficult character and has carried it off well. Her chemistry with Nani is good. First half of the film is entertaining mostly because of Nani’s antics.</p><p>Songs and dances have been picturized well. One of the important romantic scenes looks good on screen and has been shot very aesthetically</p><p><strong>Minus Points:-</strong></p><p>After watching the trailers, all those who had an opinion that Aha Kalyanam looked more like a Tamil film, are spot on. The entire culture, artists and set up is nothing like that of Telugu films. Though the weddings have been showcased well, they have an alien feel. The lack of Telugu nativity is felt sorely.</p><p>Second half of the film lacks emotional depth. In Band Baaja Baraat, the second is terrific and takes the film to another level. The entire second half has many dull moments and lacks the pace.</p><p>Aha Kalyanam is a faithful copy of Band Baaja Baarat, and those who have seen the Hindi version might not like this film.</p><p>The supporting cast is yet another drawback of this film. None of the characters make an impression, as Nani is left by himself to carry the film on his shoulders. Simran’s special appearance does not impress much.</p><p><strong>Technical Aspects:-</strong></p><p>Aha Kalyanam is high on technical values. As said earlier, all the weddings have been showcased colorfully. The art department has done a wonderful job in making this film look rich. Music of the film is just about OK, and only one or two songs are impressive. Background score is soothing.</p><p>Dialogues are impressive, and the ones written for Nani are hilarious. Screenplay of the film is apt in the first half, but some scenes in the second half lack clarity.</p><p>Director Gokul Krishna does not make a very good case for himself with this movie. He has just faithfully copied this film from the original.</p><p><strong>Verdict:-</strong></p><p>Aha Kalyanam is a film which works partially only because of Nani’s star status and talent. Sizzling chemistry from the lead pair is a plus. But a dragged out second half with not much of emotional depth spoils the fun. You can give this film a shot only for Nani, otherwise there is nothing Aaha about it</p><p><span><strong>123telugu Rating – 2.75/5</strong></span></p><p><span><strong>Reviewed by 123telugu Team</strong></span></p><p><a href=#><span><strong>CLICK HERE FOR TELUGU REVIEW</strong></span></a></p><p><b><span>Ad :</span></b> <a href=#><b><span>Teluguruchi - Learn..
