And it's hard to imagine a better name for the Texas <a href=#>mansion </a>constructed by the late Pilgrim's Pride chicken mogul "Bo" Pilgrim for $15 million than "Cluckingham Palace," the name that The Robb Report says it's known by to neighbors and other locals. Now, some lucky bidder will get the chance to own Cluckingham Palace, because it's going up for <a href=#>auction</a> very soon.</p><p>If you're not familiar with the brand name Pilgrim's Pride, there's a much better chance you've tried some of its chicken anyway, since it's a major supplier for chains like KFC and Wendy's. And in 1992, Pilgrim paid some $15 million to custom-build a "French Renaissance dream home" designed by architect Richard Drummond Davis.</p><p>And the house is indeed an impressive sight, with opulent details stuffed to every corner, like gold-leaf trimmings, marble pillars and stairs, and of course an elaborate chandelier in the entry hall.</p><p>Altogether, Cluckingham Palace spreads across more than 18,000 square feet and two levels, with six bedrooms, ten bathrooms and ten half-baths, making it hard to imagine any guest not being able to find the bathroom. There are both formal and informal dining rooms and reception areas, a spacious room for crafts (or other hobbies), multiple home offices, and a private screening room.</p><p>Arguably the home's most impressive feature apart from its colloquial moniker is the hotel-like indoor pool, reportedly modeled after the one found at the Greenbrier Resort at White Sulphur Springs in West Virginia.</p><p>And naturally the property is as impressive outside as in, with manicured gardens, three ponds and even a "meandering creek."</p><p>Of course, a property like this has to be seen to be believed, and you can do just that by checking out the video below from Concierge Auctions:</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxm60zqacrGeknbJutM6uqp5lpJ2utXnPoqOgqpmiwG680aKbnmWTnbakt8SnZJutmaHBbq%2FApaOenF2YubavyqKloKCRonqxrcuamp5lmah6tryMn6arZZGqsLW1zqdm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
