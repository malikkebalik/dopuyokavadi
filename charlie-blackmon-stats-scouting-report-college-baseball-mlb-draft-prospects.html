JC (20th round). In both cases he was taken as a lefthander, but after transferring to Georgia Tech he didn't see any time on the mound, and he redshirted in 2007. Blackmon played in the Texas Collegiate League last summer and batted .316 as an outfielder, so when he returned to Georgia Tech he got a chance as a position player and took full advantage. In his first year as a hitter, Blackmon has led the Yellow Jackets in batting and was among the team leaders in nearly every offensive category. A natural athlete, Blackmon has five tools that are quickly gaining refinement. At 6-foot-3, 200 pounds, he has the prototypical pro body. He runs well and could play any of the three outfield positions but probably fits best in left. At the plate, Blackmon has a natural lefthanded swing and makes consistent contact. While his approach is still raw, he projects to hit for power and average. He's a college senior but a young hitter, so he has plenty of room for improvement. He is one of the biggest sleepers in this year's draft.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o63SnpmapJyWuqa%2ByJyYZ5ufonyxuMCynKurX2t9dX%2BMnJ%2Baqpyesm6uy5qapKWfo3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
