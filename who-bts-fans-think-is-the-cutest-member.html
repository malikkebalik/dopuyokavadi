Some BTS fans also consider RM to be one of the cutest members.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_36>“The cutie-pie leader, who happens to be obsessed with bonsai trees, Ryan the bear, art museums,” one Quora user <a href=#>wrote</a>. “And did I mention that he has what seem to be the KEEYUTEST DIMPLES like EVER!”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jimin>Jimin</h2><p id=par-5_34>He’s BTS’ “Resident Prince Charming,” but the singer and dancer, Jimin, is also super cute. That could be because he’s the shortest member of BTS or just because he often sports brightly colored hair.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_54>“Jimin is also considered super attractive,” one <a href=#>Quora</a> user said. “He was very insecure about his cheeks and weight before, but I think he’s better about them now especially after he went on his diet to lose weight. I think he’s the most self-conscious about his looks, although he really doesn’t need to be.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-suga>Suga</h2><p id=par-7_35>Although he could appear savage and stoic, the rapper and dancer, Suga, also has his sweet and cute moments. That even earned him his “Lil Meow Meow” nickname from some members of the BTS ARMY.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_54>“First of all, Yoongi is the biggest uwu I have ever seen,” one Quora user <a href=#>wrote</a>. “Jimin is known for being the target of the boys’ small jokes, (because he’s small,) but have you guys noticed — YOONGI IS SMALL AS WELL! Maybe they don’t direct their jokes at him because, well, it’s Yoongi.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jungkook>Jungkook</h2><p id=par-9_37>He’s the youngest member of BTS, growing from a teenager to an adult with the other members. Although he’s an adult and Time Magazine’s “Sexiest International Man” of 2020, some fans still know him for being adorable.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_57>“The fact that we all have watched him grow up is something that I find strange, but it’s that change from a boy to a young adult that makes you able to see how much his looks, face have changed,” one Quora user <a href=#>wrote</a>. “He eludes such an adult, childlike innocence to him, which is so interesting.”</p><p id=par-11_36>The “Life Goes On” music video is now available on YouTube. Music by BTS, including their recently released album, Map of the Soul: 7, is available for streaming on Spotify, Apple Music, and most major platforms.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvtb%2BMn5inq12YwrWx0q1kpp2dl7KzesetpKVn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
