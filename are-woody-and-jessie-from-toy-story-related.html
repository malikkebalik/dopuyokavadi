Toy Story fans first met Jessie during the sequel to this film. Woody gets stolen from a yard sale and ends up in the apartment of a toy salesman.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_35>There, he reunited with his “roundup gang” and eventually took Jessie and Bullseye back to Andy’s house. Since then, Jessie became one of Andy’s favorite toys and the best friend of another toy, Buzz Lightyear.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_39>When it comes to Woody and Jessie’s relationship, though, these toys were just “like” siblings. It’s never confirmed that these two western-themed toys are actually related in the Pixar animated movies or as their characters in Woody’s television series.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Toy-Story-4.jpg><h2>Are Woody and Jessie from ‘Toy Story 2’ related?&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-6_39>Although Woody and Jessie binge-watched plenty of episodes of their television series while hanging out in Al’s apartment, it’s never specified if their characters were in love.
