Caitlin Upton first gained recognition on the state level as 2007's Miss South Carolina Teen USA. Following this, she was third runner-up in the Miss Teen USA pageant.

Why do you think this is?</strong>"</p><p>To which Upton answered:</p><p>"<strong>I personally believe that U.S. Americans are unable to do so because, uh, some, uh, people out there in our nation don't have maps and, uh, I believe that our education like such as in South Africa and, uh, the Iraq, everywhere like such as, and, I believe that they should, our education over here in the U.S. should help the U.S., uh, or, uh, should help South Africa and should help the Iraq and the Asian countries, so we will be able to build up our future.

However, on NBC's "The Today Show," hosts <a href=# title="Matt Lauer Net Worth">Matt Lauer</a> and <a href=# title="Ann Curry Net Worth">Ann Curry</a> gave Upton a platform to explain herself. Clarifying what happened, she said that she got overwhelmed on the stage and was unable to fully process the question she was being asked. Moreover, Lauer and Curry gave Upton another chance to answer the question. Upton responded with: "Well personally, my friends and I, we know exactly where the United States is on our map. I don't know anyone else who doesn't. And if the statistics are correct, I believe that there should be more emphasis on geography in our education so people will learn how to read maps better."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-236784 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Caitlin-Upton-1.jpg alt="Caitlin Upton Net Worth" width=398 height=594 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-236784 class=wp-caption-text>Ethan Miller/Getty Images</p><h2 id=modeling><strong>Modeling</strong></h2><p>Following her beauty pageant career, Upton began modeling in advertisements for such companies as Wrangler and Nautica.
