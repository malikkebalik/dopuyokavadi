These particular rumours surround Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Juno Temple. They suggest there is more to these minor roles than meets the eye, so let’s take a look at what these online speculators are saying.

They suggest there is more to these minor roles than meets the eye, so let’s take a look at what these online speculators are saying.</p><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=768 data-injectable=true>We’ll start off with the least plausible. A couple of months ago <a href=#>a press release</a> announced that <strong>Joseph Gordon-Levitt</strong> was part of the cast and would be playing a cop on the beat called John Blake. But clearly people aren’t satisfied with this and there is now information floating around which suggests that he’ll be playing Robin. Latino Review found the following:</p><p>The person [on Superhero Hype forums] claims that the owner of a comic book shop in Pittsburgh told them that during the recent shooting of <strong>The Dark Knight Rises</strong>, a weapons prop crew member said that “Robin was being introduced in this film.” Prodded further about who is playing Robin, the crew member allegedly said it was “the dark-haired guy from <strong>3rd Rock From the Sun</strong>.”</p><p data-characters=503 data-current-count=503 data-injectable=true>There are two reasons that you can probably ignore this rumour outright. Firstly, it’s from a forum and secondly, it’s from a guy who owns a comic book shop. This man is most likely a fan of the Batman franchise and is spreading false rumours to get people riled or excited. Also let’s not mention that both <strong>Christopher Nolan</strong> and <strong>Christian Bale</strong> have an active dislike for the character and said he won’t be part of their franchise. So for now you can pretty much ignore this one.</p><p data-characters=408 data-current-count=408 data-injectable=true>The more plausible and truthful rumour surrounds the role of<strong> Juno Temple</strong>, who has a much more oblique confirmation so far, described simply as ‘a streetwise Gotham girl’. There are now stories surfacing that she will in fact play the sidekick to Catwoman, Holly Robinson, a Gotham prostitute which again fits in with the ‘streetwise Gotham girl’ description.<a href=#>Total Film</a> found this out:</p><p>Then there’s the big one-<strong>The Dark Knight Rises</strong>, where Temple plays “street smart Gotham gal” Holly Robinson. Speculation has it that her Holly is the young prostitute first seen in Frank Miller’s&nbsp;Batman: Year One, and that she may be the sidekick to Anne Hathaway’s Catwoman.</p><p data-characters=138 data-current-count=138 data-injectable=false>In the article, Temple neither confirmed nor denied this, but it does fit. A better fit than the <strong>Joseph Gordon-Levitt</strong>/Robin rumour anyway:</p><p>I can’t talk about that. But I think it’s going to be fricking unbelievable. Nolan is awesome! There’s something really gentlemanly about him. He’s got an insane, incredible vision going on. Just getting the opportunity to work with him is awesome, says Temple.</p><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false>So there you go, that’s next chapter in the ongoing saga of rumours surrounding <strong>The Dark Knight Rises</strong>. Whether they come true or not you’ll just have to wait and see when the film gets released on July 20th, 2012.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoqa6ln6fAbr%2FWmqmmZZqkwKa8x2aeqKqUpLtuuMSvoK2so2K3trrOZquepaChsrR50aijnqtdma6zt4ykpaKfmKl6s7XSnqpo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
