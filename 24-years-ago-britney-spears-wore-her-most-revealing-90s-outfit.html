While <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>the video for her namesake single</a> flaunted skin, by way of crop tops and minis, her style had more of a girl next door vibe at the time.</p><p>During this era of her style, the “Crazy” singer often donned pigtails and baby tees — her signature for most of the 1990s. Her appearance at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards, however, changed that.</p><p>Before making her debut VMA performance in gunmetal co-ords, Spears walked the red carpet in an ultra revealing look that belongs in her wardrobe hall of fame. Spears wore a long, fur-trimmed cardigan<strong> </strong>that swept the floor. Despite having yards and yards of fabric, the garment was utterly see-through.</p><figure class="Qf5 nbP" readability=2><p>Erik Pendzich/Shutterstock</p></figure><p>Sans a bra, Spears’ only form of coverage was a smattering of sequins and two fur panels that strategically covered her breasts. She hooked one button and left the rest of the gauzy garment open, fully exposing her belly button.</p><p>She merchandised the all-black look with low-rise trousers (because ’90s) and sandals encrusted with crystals.</p><figure class="Qf5 nbP" readability=2><p>KMazur/WireImage/Getty Images</p></figure><h2>Her Makeup Was Quintessentially ’90s</h2><p>While Spears’ daring attire fits right into 2023’s spicy fashion trends, her makeup was so very ’90s.</p><p>She rocked frosted, <a href=# class=T3D>baby blue eyeshadow</a> with black eyeliner and dusted her entire face with shimmering bronzer.</p><figure class="Qf5 nbP" readability=2><p>KMazur/WireImage/Getty Images</p></figure><h2>Oops!... She Did It Again</h2><p>With the turn of the millennium, Spears’ style sensibilities pivoted to the spicier side — making her earlier look seem downright tame. Just a year later, Spears debuted another revealing sheer look, <a href=# class=T3D>donning her first whale tail</a> at the 2000 MTV VMAs (a monumental moment).</p><figure class="Qf5 nbP" readability=2><p>KMazur/WireImage/Getty Images</p></figure><p>It wouldn’t be ’til 2009, a decade after her first sheer ’fit, that she’d return to the see-through look. I’m talking about the barely-there masterpiece: her glistening “Toxic” bodysuit.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Screenshot via YouTube/BritneySpearsVEVO</p></figure><p>Spears has always had a spicy streak.
