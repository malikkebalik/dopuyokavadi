Let's look at every Pink Floyd album in order for 1967 to 2014, leaving aside live records, compilations, box sets, and unofficial bootlegs.
Published on July 25, 2023   5 min read They made a legitimate claim to the classic rock throne in the 1970s, but Pink Floyd’s discography spanned decades. Many listeners misunderstood their biggest hit, and while the songs might be open to interpretation, the order of Pink Floyd’s albums is set and stone."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Many <a href=#>listeners misunderstood their biggest hit</a>, and while the songs might be open to interpretation, the order of Pink Floyd’s albums is set and stone.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-the-five-pink-floyd-members-created-15-studio-albums>The five Pink Floyd members created 15 studio albums</h2><p id=par-2_32>Aside from a few early concerts, Pink Floyd only operated as a quartet. Still, the shadow of Syd Barrett loomed over the band for years, even after they moved on without him.</p><p id=par-3_56>Barrett put Pink Floyd on the map as the singer, primary songwriter, and lead guitarist. He and bandmates Roger Waters (bass), Richard Wright (keyboards), and Nick Mason (drums) established themselves as the flagship band for psychedelic underground London in 1967. By the end of the year, Barrett was already on the path toward his post-Floyd life.</p><p id=par-4_65>His mental disintegration — likely attributed to an underlying mental illness and copious LSD consumption — left him unwilling or unable to maintain his music career. He played songs in the wrong key, sang the wrong words, and changed the arrangements on the fly. The band, hoping to salvage success from their early hit songs, recruited David Gilmour to play guitar while Barrett wildly improvised.</p><p id=par-5_48>Eventually, Pink Floyd moved on without Barrett. Gilmour, Mason, Waters, and Wright continued without the band’s founder starting in early 1968. Eventually, that second quartet gave the world some of the best albums (and <a href=#>greatest album covers</a>) of all time. Let’s look at Pink Floyd’s albums in order.</p><p id=par-6_28>(<strong>Note:</strong> We’re counting only studio albums, so we’re not including compilations, collections of outtakes, or bootlegs.
