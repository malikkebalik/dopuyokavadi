But, there’s only room for two of them to address the Jury.</p><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>When the game shifts to the final three, the week-to-week structure is overhauled. In a typical round of play, the houseguests first battle to become the Head of Household (HoH) while the outgoing HoH sits on the sidelines. And then later, the Power of Veto is up for grabs for a select few contestants. After the Veto ceremony, one of the two nominees is evicted from the house.</p><p data-characters=238 data-current-count=618 data-injectable=true>With only three players remaining and finale night days away, the Power of Veto is scrapped — the golden necklace is no longer in play. Instead, Jag, Matt, and Bowie Jane will compete for the Head of Household in a three-part skirmish.</p><p data-characters=127 data-current-count=127 data-injectable=false>And although Bowie Jane was the final four HoH, she’s eligible to play for the last Head of Household of Big Brother 25.</p><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=356 data-injectable=false>The three have already played in the first part (I’ll reveal who won later in this article). The winner automatically earned themselves a spot in the third part of the final HoH, which will play out during the live finale.</p><p data-characters=224 data-current-count=580 data-injectable=true>The other two are set to compete in part two. And the winner of that competition will meet the first part’s victor in part three. That means whoever loses both parts one and two cannot win the final Head of Household.</p><p data-characters=555 data-current-count=555 data-injectable=true>The two others will duke it out in part three, and whoever wins the competition becomes the most powerful houseguest of the season. They take over the HoH throne for the final time of the season. And unlike every other round of play, the final three Head of Household has the power to cast an eviction vote. Not only that, they’re the only ones to do so. The two losers will sit in the eviction chairs and the Head of Household will choose who moves forward with them and who suffers the fate of Big Brother 25’s final evictee and Jury member.</p><p data-characters=272 data-current-count=272 data-injectable=false>The eviction will take place after the final Head of Household is determined. And whoever is left standing will go on to answer the Jury’s questions, and after that, the final vote will take place — the seven-person Jury will decide who walks away with the money.</p><p data-characters=134 data-current-count=406 data-injectable=false>Matt has already punched his ticket to part three by winning part one, and either Jag or Bowie Jane will join him by winning part two.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ypu9Zmm6ido2LBqbGMm6CgZZKnvLW0xKtkn6Gelrluf4ywpqujXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
