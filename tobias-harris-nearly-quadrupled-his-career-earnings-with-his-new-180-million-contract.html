Harris and the Philadelphia 76ers agreed to a five-year, $180 million contract to keep the forward in the City of Brotherly Love."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He's been on five teams over the course of eight years and has never spent more than three full seasons in any one city. But it looks like all of that is going to change with his newest deal.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Harris and the Philadelphia 76ers agreed to a five-year, $180 million contract to keep the forward in the City of Brotherly Love.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>It's a huge deal for Harris. For one, it shows the Sixers are committed to him as a major piece in their championship aspirations. Prior to this year's playoffs, Harris had only appeared in four postseason games over the course of his career. It was the classic case of putting up good numbers on bad teams, and now Harris will get a shot on a championship contender.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>It's also financially a huge deal. In his eight seasons, Harris has made $70,869,074. Certainly not chump change, but this new contract is worth nearly three times that. By the time this deal ends, Harris will have almost quadrupled his career earnings.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-283721 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1143619881.jpg alt width=900 height=610 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-283721 class=wp-caption-text>Elsa/Getty Images</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The Sixers acquired Harris in the middle of the season, one of two major mid-season acquisitions. Their other big get, guard <a href=# rel=noopener>Jimmy Butler</a>, was just traded to the Miami Heat as part of a four-team deal.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Philadelphia gave up a lot to get Harris – an unprotected 2021 pick from Miami, a 2020 lottery-protected pick, and promising young guard Landry Shamet. It would have been difficult for the Sixers to stomach losing both Butler and Harris.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The Sixers will look different next season. Apart from Butler, the team also lost <a href=# rel=noopener>J.J. Redick</a> to the New Orleans Pelicans. Philadelphia received Josh Richardson in the Butler trade and signed <a href=# rel=noopener>Al Horford</a> to a four-year deal.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Is that team good enough to surpass last year's Eastern Conference semifinals appearance? The Sixers certainly hope so, and they paid a high price to keep one of their core pieces intact.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>And in a few years, Harris can say he's made more than a quarter billion dollars in the NBA. That's a fantastic accomplishment.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2Fjq2mm6GRqHqprdGroKxlnpqus7jYZqiumZSnwrG4xJ1koaGjYrCivsSeqWadkae7qrrGrGSwoaSdeqm10malnq9dZoVxecyio6Whn6N6pLvNramam6Rk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
