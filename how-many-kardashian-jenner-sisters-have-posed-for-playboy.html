Published on September 20, 2019   3 min read Recently, Keeping Up with the Kardashians stars Kylie Jenner and partner Travis Scott grabbed headlines by appearing together in Playboy. The pair coupled their racy photographs with an interview where Scott asked Jenner personal questions about her life of fame. While they’ve been gobbling up attention with their sexy photoshoot and intimate discussion, Jenner isn’t the only member of the Jenner-Kardashian group to have made the choice to bare it all for one of the world’s most famous nude magazines."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

They sell photographs of themselves through their social media accounts, appear in racy advertisements for the brands they represent, and even make money on in-person appearances. Keeping that in mind, it makes sense that these women would be comfortable in their own skin and have no problem showing off their bodies to the public.&nbsp;</p><h2>Kim Kardashian has posed for the magazine</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-3_75>Sex sells, and no one knows that better than Kim Kardashian. After all, the reality star’s launch into fame happened when a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>sex tape</a> with her ex Ray J went public. While the star has expressed frustration about the lack of privacy in her life, she has made several daring appearances that showcase her body. Her photo shoot for Paper Magazine famously “broke the internet” with sexy images of her nude body taking center stage.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_67>Back in 2007, though, Kardashian was less comfortable taking it all off for the public. When she was <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>asked to pose for Playboy</a>, it took the legendary Hugh Hefner to convince her to go through with it. She eventually agreed, and the world was tantalized with stunning pictures of her draped only in pearls. Today, Kardashian remembers this shoot as one of her favorites of all time.&nbsp;</p><h2>Kris Jenner has declined an appearance&nbsp;</h2><figure class="rt-ig-embed wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-5_39>The family is definitely supportive of one another in their daring and risqué acts of publicity. Upon seeing Jenner’s Instagram posts teasing the Playboy shoot, sister Khloe Kardashian wrote: “You are so beautiful Kylie!!!! Wow wow wow wow.”</p><p id=par-6_51>Still, there is one member of the family who has assured us she will not be appearing in the nude: matriarch Kris Jenner.&nbsp;Her reluctance to pose for Playboy is not about a sense of modesty or morality: Jenner simply believes that she’s gotten too old for that kind of work.</p><p id=par-7_81>“I don’t think anybody wants to see me without any clothes on,” <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>she explained</a>. She went on to say:&nbsp;“The older you get, the harder it is. I love to work out and love to feel like I’m in shape and I like to feel good about myself. Last summer I posted those bikini photos because I thought it was so inspirational for someone in their fifties to have some motivation and say, ‘Wow, anybody can try to put a bathing-suit on.'”</p><p id=par-8_31>It appear that’s as far as the celebrity will be taking her striptease, though. She’ll leave the work of stripping all the way down to her younger, and perhaps bolder, daughters.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_96>As of right now, Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner are the only two family members who have posed nude for Playboy. But Kardashian’s positive memories of the experience and Jenner’s moment in the spotlight from her participation make it likely that the other sisters may follow in their footsteps in the future. After all, the entire clan is famous for flaunting their bodies and selling intimate glimpses into their personal lives. What better way to showcase their confidence and beauty than with a magazine that has been helping celebrities bare it all for nearly seven decades?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS1sMOMppinsV2grrOwwKyfopmeYremus2eqWarmajBpr7SZp%2BarpVivbC%2FxJ1kn6eiYr2trdibprJmmKm6rXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
