Given the state of his lair and the character’s absence from the scene, many fans have all but assumed that he didn’t survive his encounter with the Mad Titan."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Given the state of his lair and the character’s absence from the scene, many fans have all but assumed that he didn’t survive his encounter with the Mad Titan. Actor Benicio del Toro, however, seems optimistic about The Collector’s fate, hinting during his appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon that Taneleer Tivan may still have a future in the MCU yet.</p><p>“I think he’s alive, yeah, I think that you know, I think he’s alive.”</p><p data-characters=231 data-current-count=231 data-injectable=false>Of course, even if we had seen The Collector die on camera, we couldn’t be sure that he was out of the franchise for good, seeing how there’s hardly a death in this film that fans haven’t suspected might soon be reversed.</p><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=585 data-injectable=true>In particular, the mass dusting that ended the movie is almost inevitably going to be undone, with several of the perished characters already having sequels lined up.
