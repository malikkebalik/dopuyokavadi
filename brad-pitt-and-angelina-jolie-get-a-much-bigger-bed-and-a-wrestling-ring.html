He said it was “Just big enough. One more and we’ll have to go to 11 feet.”</p><p>The Jolie-Pitts have a giant custom bed in their rented compound in Cedar Creek, Texas outside of Austin, and it sounds bigger than their last bed. It was custom built for the professional wrestler the Undertaker who owns the home and the bedroom had to be built super big to create enough space for the bed. It sounds like they’ll have enough room for the two more than Angelina is rumored to be expecting. What’s more is that there’s a big old wrestling ring in their house:</p><p>“The best part of the house is a separate gym area with a real [World Wrestling Entertainment] ring in it,” contractor Ron Charlies, who worked on the home’s construction, tells Life & Style. “I’m sure Brad and the kids horse around in it.”</p><p>There’s plenty of space for dad Brad and mom Angelina Jolie )who’s more than five months pregnant) in the four-bedroom ranch, which Brad and Angelina are renting in Cedar Creek from its owner, the pro wrestler known as Undertaker. “The master bedroom is 28 feet by 48 feet,” says Charles. “It’s bigger than most <i>houses</i> here. It wasn’t that big originally, but Undertaker wanted a huge special bed, so we had to make the room a lot larger to accommodate it.”</p><p>[From In Touch, print edition, April 7, 2008]</p><p>Brad and Angelina were said to have chosen the estate due to the relative privacy and the fact that it was set off from the road, but I bet that giant bed was a selling point too. Can you imagine Maddox jumping around in the wrestling ring? That contractor is probably right that their kids enjoy playing on it.</p><p>I toured one of Frank Lloyd Wright’s homes that he designed and lived in outside of Chicago and it had <a href=#>a big playroom</a> for his kids with a huge vaulted ceiling. That’s only tangentially related since Pitt toured one of Wright’s houses with Angelina, but you could see him having huge rooms built just for his kids to play in. In this case the house already came with one, you just need to watch your kids carefully to make sure they’re not jumping off the sides and body slamming each other.</p><p>Brad and Angelina are shown biking with their kids in New Orleans on 12/22/07, thanks to Splash News.
