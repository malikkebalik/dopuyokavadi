So-called alternatives, those assets such as infrastructure and private equity meant for sophisticated investors, make up just 3% of the nearly $9 trillion of assets that BlackRock manages. They contribute just 11% of base fees.

The business now has $34 billion of dry powder to invest. Once that's deployed, those investments will eventually add some $260 million of annual base fees, Kapito said.</p><p class=premium>"You can see how important alternatives are going to be for the future of BlackRock," he said during the conference held by Bank of America on February 16.&nbsp;</p><p class=premium>The money manager has been on a mission to grow its $318 billion alternatives business. Behind the firm's push: already-low fees <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module=body_link>under pressure</a> in BlackRock's core fund business, the fast-expanding private markets, and demand from clients. The stakes are high.</p><p class=premium>The leadership team steering the alternatives business has changed recently. Jim Barry, the chief investment officer for the unit, decided to leave the firm last year. The capital-markets executive Brent Patry's role was expanded last fall to include the role of deputy head of alternatives.
