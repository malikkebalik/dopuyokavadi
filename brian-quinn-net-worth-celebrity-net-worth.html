In 2011, the group began starring on its own hidden-camera comedy television show, "Impractical Jokers." Quinn later starred with the Tenderloins on the comedy game show "The Misery Index."</p><h2 id=early-life-education><strong>Early Life and Education</strong></h2><p>Brian Quinn was born on March 14, 1976 in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. When he was still an infant, he moved with his family to Staten Island. He is of Italian and Irish descent. As a teenager, Quinn went to Monsignor Farrell High School, a boys' Catholic school. It was there that he met his friends and collaborators Sal Vulcano, James Murray, and Joe Gatto, with whom he performed in the school's improvisation club. Quinn went on to attend Brooklyn College. Subsequently, for eight years, he served in the New York City Fire Department.</p><h2 id=tenderloins><strong>The Tenderloins</strong></h2><p>Formed in the late 90s, the comedy troupe the Tenderloins originally consisted of James Murray, Sal Vulcano, Joe Gatto, and Mike Boccio. Initially, the group performed as a live improv and sketch comedy troupe. The four members later added Gideon Horowitz. The Tenderloins achieved great success with their live shows, and eventually decided to venture into filmed comedy sketches. After Boccio and Horowitz left the group, Quinn stepped in to become the fourth member. The Tenderloins went on to produce sketches for YouTube, Myspace, and Metacafe, earning millions of views in the process. In 2007, the group performed a sketch on the NBC reality competition program "It's Your Show" and won the $100,000 grand prize.</p><p>In late 2011, the members of the Tenderloins launched the hidden-camera comedy television show "Impractical Jokers" on truTV. The show features the members, or "jokers," as they challenge each other to a series of competitive games and dares in which they usually end up embarrassing themselves in public. At the end of a typical episode, the joker who has lost the most challenges is given a particularly humiliating form of punishment. "Impractical Jokers" was a huge hit upon release, becoming the most popular series on truTV. It spawned "Impractical Jokers: The Movie," which came out in early 2020. The Tenderloins also starred on the TBS comedy game show "The Misery Index," based on the card game "Shit Happens" and hosted by <a href=# title="Jameela Jamil Net Worth">Jameela Jamil</a>.
