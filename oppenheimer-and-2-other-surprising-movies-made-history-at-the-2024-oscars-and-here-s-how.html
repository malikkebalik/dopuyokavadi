One thing is for sure, though: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">history was made on March 10</a>…</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Milestone wins</h2><h2 data-injectable=false>Cillian Murphy wins the Oscar for Best Actor</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/cillian-murphy-oppenheimer-1.jpg><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true>The Irish have been dominating the entertainment industry in the past few years. Paul Mescal, Andrew Scott, Barry Keoghan, Colin Farrell, Saoirse Ronan, Brendan Gleeson, Kerry Condon, Ruth Negga, Fiona Shaw, and, of course, Cillian Murphy — the world of movies and television owes a great debt of gratitude to the great nation of Ireland. And yet, never has an Irish-born person won an Oscar for Best Actor. Until now.</p><p data-characters=392 data-current-count=392 data-injectable=false>I know what you’re thinking — what about one of the greatest actors of all time and three-time Best Actor winner Daniel Day-Lewis? Well, DDL does indeed have British-Irish citizenship, but he was born in London. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Murphy led the race</a> after securing the SAG award in February, and sure enough his Best Actor win serves as a fitting climax to the Hollywood Irish renaissance of the 2020s.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Justine Triet wins the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Justine-Triet.jpg><p data-characters=419 data-current-count=419 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Anatomy of a Fall</a> Nation was holding out hope Justine Triet would win at least one Oscar on Sunday (I know this because I, too, am part of it). Despite her film taking Cannes and the world by storm this past year, Triet unfortunately wasn’t the favorite to win in either of the categories she was up for; <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Original Screenplay</a> (she co-wrote Anatomy of a Fall with her partner Arthur Harari) and Best Director.</p><p data-characters=405 data-current-count=405 data-injectable=true>And yet, against all the odds, a miracle struck on Sunday and Triet came away with the Best Original Screenplay gong. This means she is the first French woman to win in that category. Due to Christopher Nolan beating her to Best Director, though, it’s still a fact that only three women have won the Oscar for Best Director in the past (Kathryn Bigelow, 2010; Chloé Zhao, 2021; Jane Campion, 2022).</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The Zone of Interest wins the Oscar for Best International Film</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/the-zone-of-interest.jpeg><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=648 data-injectable=true>The Best International Feature Film category was a funny one this year. Anatomy of a Fall, a French movie nominated in almost every big category, was not France’s submission for the bracket. Perfect Days is a Japanese film made by a German man, and Italy’s submission, Io Capitano, barely has a lick of Italian in its two-hour runtime.</p><p data-characters=361 data-current-count=361 data-injectable=false>Similarly, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Zone of Interest,</a> spoken entirely in German and set in Poland, is a British film. As a result, the Oscar winner stands as the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">UK’s first-ever win</a> in the Best International Film category. The space is reserved for movies spoken not in the English language. The UK’s previous nominees in the category were for films with Welsh dialogue.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Missed milestone wins</h2><h2 id=h-lily-gladstone-winning-the-oscar-for-best-actress data-injectable=false>Lily Gladstone winning the Oscar for Best Actress</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Lily-Gladstone.jpg><p data-characters=443 data-current-count=443 data-injectable=true>Lily Gladstone has already made history by becoming the first Native American person to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress (three other, non-American, Indigenous women have been nominated before — Merle Oberon, Keisha Castle-Hughes, and Yalitza Aparicio). They also became the first Native American/Indigenous winner of the SAG Award in the same category, sending them well on their way to repeating the feat at the Oscars.</p><p data-characters=720 data-current-count=720 data-injectable=true>Gladstone’s arresting performance as Mollie Burkhart in Killers of the Flower Moon would’ve granted the actress her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">first career Oscar</a> and made her the first Indigenous woman to win for an acting performance and the first Native American Oscar winner ever. Of course, this didn’t end up happening as Emma Stone took the gong for the second time for Poor Things. Likewise Osage Nation songwriter Scott George, and the author of Best Original Song contender <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Wahzhazhe (A Song For My People),”</a> would’ve made history if he won as the first Native American man to be nominated in this category. However, Billie Eilish topped the category for Barbie‘s “What Was I Made For?”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>John Williams winning the Oscar for Best Original Score</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/John-Williams.jpg><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=667 data-injectable=true>John Williams’s place in the Oscars Hall of Fame is already firmly established. The 91-year-old is the most-nominated living person with a total of 54 nods over the years. In 2024, he added the title of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the oldest person to ever be nominated for a competitive Oscar</a> with his Best Original Score nomination for his work in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.</p><p data-characters=479 data-current-count=479 data-injectable=true>If Williams won, he would’ve become the oldest Oscar winner ever — a record currently in the hands of James Ivory, who was 89 when he won the award for Best Adapted Screenplay for Call Me By Your Name. Still, although he lost in this instance to Ludwig Göransson for his work on Oppenheimer, the legendary composer will find comfort in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the five Oscars he already possesses</a> for Schindler’s List, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Star Wars, Jaws, and Fiddler on the Roof.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Oppenheimer winning more than 11 Oscars</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/oppenheimer-featured.jpg><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=510 data-injectable=true>Movies like Ben-Hur, Titanic, and Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King are the stuff of Academy Award legend. For decades they have enjoyed a three-way tie for most awarded movies, winning 11 Oscars each.</p><p data-characters=426 data-current-count=426 data-injectable=true>With 13 nominations on its back going into the ceremony, Oppenheimer stood a strong chance of<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> deserving a spot in that illustrious list</a>, especially as it was the favorite to win in at least eight of the categories (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Supporting Actor, Cinematography, Original Score, Film Editing, and Sound). As it happened, the film only took home seven of those eight, losing out Best Sound to Zone of Interest.</p><p data-characters=409 data-current-count=409 data-injectable=true>Even so, seven is nothing to sniff at and its multiple Oscar wins put a nice bow on the Barbenheimer phenomenon, as well as the achievements of Nolan’s film in its own right as a near-billion dollar box office smash (despite being a 3-hour long biopic composed mostly of dialogue and complicated <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">quantum physics theory</a>). 2023 will go down in the history of film, and Oppenheimer was a big part of that.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Martin Scorsese winning the Oscar for Best Director</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Martin-Scorsese.jpg><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=654 data-injectable=true>Martin Scorsese is a champion of cinema and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the greatest directors of all time</a>. Frankly, we’re all begging for time to pause so he doesn’t get any older and can continue making movies for all eternity. His latest, Killers Of The Flower Moon, was a sweeping drama about the exploitation of the Osage at the hands of greedy oil dealers.</p><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=326 data-injectable=false>Christopher Nolan was the favorite to win the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Oscar for Best Director</a>, so it was no surprise that he took home the statuette. If Scorsese won, however — and he was every bit as deserving — he would’ve been the oldest winner in the category, at 81 years old. Clint Eastwood was 74 when he won for Million Dollar Baby.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Thelma Schoonmaker winning the Oscar for Best Editing</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Thelma-Schoonmaker.jpg><p data-characters=547 data-current-count=547 data-injectable=true>Of course, when you talk about Marty, you have to talk about Thelma. Possibly the greatest director-editor duo of all time, Scorsese’s film very nearly gave Thelma Schoonmaker a chance at making history too. The editor almost finally broke out of the four-way tie she’s been in since she won the Oscar for Best Editing for The Departed in 2007, bringing her total to three trophies (she had previously won for The Aviator and Raging Bull). Michael Kahn, Daniel Mandell, and Ralph Dawson all have three Oscars for Best Editing as well.</p><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>As it was, Schoonmaker lost out to Jennifer Lame for Oppenheimer, as predicted. Nevertheless, the turn of events shouldn’t be too sore for Schoonmaker as she remains the single most nominated person in the category with nine nods over the years — all but one for collaborations with Scorsese.</p><p data-characters=67 data-current-count=367 data-injectable=false>The source for all records included in this article is USBets.com.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqrjLZqapqJWjtaa1zJ6pZpmemXqstculnKurXaSzbsDHnmSfpJ%2BssrN5zKimp2Wdlrimec6smpqqXZ22tMDOq7Bmp55iwLa6w5qwaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
