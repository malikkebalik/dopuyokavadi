Jason Weaver began his professional acting career in the early 90s, appearing in such projects as "The Kid Who Loved Christmas", "Brewster Place", "The Long Walk Home", and "The Jacksons: An American Dream". He then went on to a steady career in both film and television projects, including, "Sister, Sister", "Freedom Song", "Drumline", "The Ladykillers", "ATL", "Jada", "Love for Sale", "Lottery Ticket", "The LeBrons", "He's Mine Not Yours", and "Dysfunctional Friends".</p><p>Jason is most widely recognized for his roles on "Thea" and "Smart Guy" and for providing the singing voice of Simba in "The Lion King". He released one studio album, "Love Ambition", in 1995, and one EP, "Stay With Me", the following year. He also performed on the popular track, "Once Call Away", with Chingy.</p><h2 id=lion-king-salary-earnings><strong>Lion King Salary/Earnings</strong></h2><p>In an October 2019 interview with VladTV, Jason revealed that he turned down a $2 million flat fee for his role in The Lion King. That's around $3.5 million after adjusting for inflation to today's dollars.</p><p>Instead he opted for $100,000 plus a share of future royalties from the songs and movie. In the interview he claimed that this choice turned out to be very wise because he still earns checks to this day, decades later, and his total earnings have easily topped the original $2 million offer.</p><p>On the other hand, the counter argument would be that $1 million in 1994 (after paying taxes) invested in the S&P 500 with dividend reinvestment, would conservatively be $9 million today.</p><p>Weaver explained that since he was a minor at the time the film was made, it was actually his mother who made the decision:</p><p><strong>"Disney had a reputation for re-releasing stuff…I think at that time they had put out Sleeping Beauty and some of their old catalog from when <a href=# title="Walt Disney Net Worth">Walt Disney</a> was alive. They were releasing that stuff when they were releasing the new Disney stuff, so she [Weaver's mother] was able to see the playing field and go, 'Wait a minute, this is going to make a lot of money over time, so what happens when my son turns 40? Is he going to be able to get a check for this when they eventually re-release this."</strong></p><p>"The Lion King" earned just under $1 billion at the box office from its original run and at least another billion from home video sales and licensing. After adjusting for inflation, the original box office gross makes "The Lion King" the <a href=#>highest grossing animated film of all time.</a></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-288431 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-57219448.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-288431 class=wp-caption-text>Frazer Harrison/Getty Images</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Jason Michael Weaver was born on July 18, 1979, in Chicago, Illinois.</p><p>Weaver grew up in a supportive environment that nurtured his artistic talents.
