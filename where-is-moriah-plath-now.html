The 21-year-old lived with Ethan Plath and Olivia Plath, as <a href=#>Moriah and Olivia became incredibly close</a>. In season 2, Kim and Barry Plath kicked Moriah out of the house.</p><p id=par-3_57>Olivia also rebelled against the Plath family. She seemingly corrupted Ethan with her modern approach to life, which initially attracted Moriah, too. Moriah, Olivia, Ethan, and Olivia’s brother, Nathan Meggs, rented a house together. While Moriah was living with Olivia and Ethan for quite a while, she chose to move out, as seen in season 5.</p><p id=par-4_94>“I don’t know how this is gonna play out,” Moriah explained on the show. “But I do know when it comes to Olivia, I don’t feel even guilty at all for just saying, ‘Hey look.&nbsp;You were my best friend&nbsp;for a while, I love you, I wish you the best, but I don’t wanna be a part of it anymore.’ It’s sad, it’s really, really sad, especially because I know that by me ending my relationship with Olivia, I probably won’t have a relationship with Ethan for a while. But this is what I needed.”</p><p id=par-5_74>Moriah moved out when Olivia and Ethan took an extended stay in Europe. The sudden change shocked both Olivia and Ethan. “I am very frustrated and genuinely surprised,” Ethan said. “Moriah had told me before we left for Europe that she was gonna stay a couple weeks after I got back. But then something happens that she doesn’t like, packs up all her stuff, that does feel a little bit theatrical, if you will.”</p><p id=par-6_37>It’s unclear precisely what Moriah’s next move is. But she seemingly plans to stay in Tampa, Florida. From the look of her Instagram, she lives in a new Florida apartment with the dog she adopted in 2022.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Moriah Plath became a bartender after graduating from bartending school</h2><p id=par-7_30>Fans see Moriah Plath in Welcome to Plathville Season 5 — but she’s not just a reality TV star.

I’m not the quickest learner, but they made sure that in just a few weeks, I was 100% confident in my bartending skills!”</p><p id=par-9_60>Moriah also explained her next steps, as she’s “in school for other things” while she bartends. “I’ve now graduated and am enjoying bartending events, and am in school for other things, but I hop on over now and then to sit in on a class if I want to learn more drinks or just refresh my memory!” she added.</p><p id=par-10_7>Additionally, Moriah still sings and dances.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She’s taking a step back from her relationship with Olivia Plath, as seen in ‘Welcome to Plathville’ Season 5</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-11_36>While Moriah Plath rebelled against her parents in the past, she hopes to rebuild her relationship with them in Welcome to Plathville Season 5.
