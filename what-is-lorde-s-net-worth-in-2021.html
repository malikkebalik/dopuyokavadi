The song has since been certified&nbsp;Diamond&nbsp;with over 10 million copies sold. The track won two&nbsp;Grammy Awards&nbsp;for&nbsp;Best Pop Solo Performance&nbsp;and&nbsp;Song of the Year, while Pure Heroine earned a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album.</p><p id=par-4_49>Her sophomore album, Melodrama, was released in 2017. It was more mature in tone than her debut, and was a snapshot of her life as she entered her twenties. The album debuted atop the Billboard 200 albums chart and contained hit songs such as “Green Light” and “Liability.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lorde-new-zealand.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lorde-s-net-worth-in-2021>Lorde’s net worth in 2021</h2><p id=par-5_27>Lorde has amassed a sizable personal fortune as a result of her years of hard work. According to <a href=#>CelebrityNetWorth</a>, she’s worth approximately $16 million in 2021.</p><p id=par-6_92>Lorde has been involved in several philanthropic causes throughout her career, mostly in New Zealand and throughout the Pacific. Her early song “The Love Club” was included in the 2013 charity album&nbsp;Songs for the Philippines&nbsp;to support the people in the Philippines who suffered from&nbsp;Typhoon Haiyan.&nbsp;In 2015, she recorded a charity single, “Team Ball Player Thing,” which raised funds for research for the cure of&nbsp;Batten disease, a fatal&nbsp;neurodegenerative&nbsp;disorder. That same year, she was featured in the compilation album&nbsp;The Art of Peace: Songs for Tibet II&nbsp;to raise funds for the preservation of the&nbsp;Tibetan culture.</p><p id=par-7_38>In 2016, Lorde donated NZ$20,000 (approximately $13,000 USD) to Fuel the Need, a New Zealand charity that provides lunches for underprivileged schoolchildren. In 2018, she donated NZ$5,000 (about $3,000 USD) to&nbsp;Starship children’s hospital in Auckland&nbsp;for new portable&nbsp;neurology monitors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lorde.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lorde-s-new-album-solar-power>Lorde’s new album, ‘Solar Power’</h2><p id=par-8_44>Now, four years after the release of Melodrama, Lorde has entered the next era of her career. Her third album Solar Power was released in August 2021, and was preceded by the singles “Solar Power,” “Stoned at the Nail Salon,” and “Mood Ring.”</p><p id=par-9_82>The album was first teased after the release of&nbsp;Going South, a June 2021&nbsp;memoir&nbsp;documenting Lorde’s 2019 visit to&nbsp;Antarctica, which she declared the precursor to the album. The album’s title was inspired by the trip, and she told <a href=#>The New York Times</a> that she “felt like [she] could just chill out and flex a little bit” while creating the record. She also noted that she didn’t feel pressure to release hit songs like she once did, and dubbed Solar Power her “weed album.”</p><p id=par-10_54>She also brushed off claims that having Jack Antonoff as a co-writer on her projects meant that she wasn’t an accomplished songwriter and artist herself. “I haven’t made a&nbsp;Jack Antonoff&nbsp;record,” she said plainly. “I’ve made a Lorde record and he’s helped me make it and very much deferred to me on production and arrangement.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqa3TZqCsZZykv6WxjKecrWWnpL%2B1tIyipWZqYGd%2Bb7TTpqNo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
